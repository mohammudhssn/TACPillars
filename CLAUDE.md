# PROJECT: TAC Knowledge Architecture

## ALWAYS DO FIRST:
1. Read /docs/3_ontology.txt (pillar definitions)
2. Read /data/pillar_7_reference.json (structure template)
3. Read /data/pillars.json (current state)

## RULES:
- Never generate content for a pillar without stating its boundaries first
- One pillar per session
- Generate one layer at a time (Sub-Pillars → Branches → Topic Domains)
- Always validate before committing
- Match the scale and structure of Pillar 7 reference

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
- All architecture work outputs as JSON matching pillar_7_reference.json structure
- Commit messages format: "Pillar X: [action] - Y Sub-Pillars, Z Branches, N Topic Domains"
