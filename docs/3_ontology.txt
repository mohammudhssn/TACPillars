THE 8 PILLARS
These eight pillars together contain every domain of anesthesia as a profession, science, business, workforce, and lived human experience.
1. Clinical Science and Perioperative Care
What it covers:

Is this something a clinician does to or for the patient?
What it excludes:
 Workforce models, compensation, scope laws, hospital politics, wellbeing.


2. People, Roles, Training and Credentialing
What it covers:
 Definitions of anesthesia roles (CRNA, MDA, AA, SRNA), their training pathways, scopes of practice, credentialing, authority boundaries, and interprofessional dynamics (including CRNA–MDA relationships).

 Is this about who the provider is, what their role permits, and how they are authorized to practice?
What it excludes:
 Career transitions, workforce shortages, burnout, economics, OR operations.
