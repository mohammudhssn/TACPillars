TAC CONTENT ARCHITECT WORKFLOW
(Authoritative Production Process for Building the Knowledge System)
This workflow governs how every piece of knowledge is added, validated, stress-tested, and locked into the TAC architecture. If someone is creating or revising anything in the system, they follow this sequence.
The purpose is simple:
Preserve purity of the architecture, prevent overlap, and guarantee completeness.
________________


1. Start With the Approved Architecture File
Before anything is built:
• Open the current TAC Knowledge Architecture Guidebook
• Confirm the Pillar, Sub-Pillar, Branch, Topic Domain, Subtopic, and Knowledge Element chain is accurate
• Confirm numbering matches the canonical format
• Confirm no level above the one you're building is still under debate
If architecture is in flux at that layer, you STOP.
________________


2. Always Build Vertically, One Slice at a Time
Every project starts with a single vertical slice and drills down:
Pillar
→ Sub-Pillar
→ Branch
→ Topic Domain
→ Subtopic
→ Knowledge Elements
You do not generate Subtopics until a Topic Domain is fully defined.
You do not generate Knowledge Elements until one Subtopic is fully defined.
You do not generate educational content until Knowledge Elements are locked.
This protects the system from premature expansion and ensures every layer matches the constraints above it.
________________


3. Use the Vertical Build Protocol
For each slice:
3.1 Define the level
Example: “Define Topic Domain 7.2.3B-2.”
3.2 Restate the upstream constraints
AI must restate:
• Pillar definition
• Sub-Pillar objective
• Branch lens
• Topic Domain purpose
This forces alignment and prevents drift.
3.3 Generate the first draft
Allow AI to produce a clean, structurally correct output for that level.
________________


4. Stress-Test Before Moving Forward
Never build down to the next layer until the current layer survives stress testing.
Stress tests check:
4.1 Completeness
Ask:
“Does this fully describe the Topic Domain if someone had to teach it without help?”
4.2 Non-overlap
Ask:
“Does any component belong somewhere else in the architecture?”
4.3 Scope purity
Ask:
“Is this trying to do the job of the layer above or below it?”
4.4 Necessity
Ask:
“If this section were removed, would the Topic Domain still be complete?”
4.5 Dimensional boundaries
Ask:
“Is this consistent with the Pillar, Sub-Pillar, and Branch constraints?”
Every failure must be addressed before continuing.

5. Lock Levels Before Descending
A level is considered “locked” only when:
• It is fully defined
• It has passed stress testing
• The architect signs off
• Numbering is assigned
• It is inserted into the master architecture document
If it is not locked, you are not allowed to build downward.
________________


6. Once Locked, Begin the Next Level
After a Subtopic is locked:
• Generate Knowledge Element sets
• Stress test for atomicity and exclusivity
• Ensure each element is only one idea
• Ensure nothing overlaps across elements
• Ensure the set fully covers the Subtopic
Do not produce educational assets until the Knowledge Elements are locked.
________________


7. Produce Content Only After Architecture Is Final
Once Knowledge Elements are locked, then and only then:
• Create course modules
• Write checklists
• Build assessments
• Write scripts for videos
• Create templates or worksheets
• Generate examples and case studies
Every asset is explicitly mapped to:
Pillar → Sub-Pillar → Branch → Domain → Subtopic → Knowledge Element.
This mapping becomes a metadata tag.
________________


8. Contributor Submission Protocol
When contractors or subject matter experts produce content, they must:
• Identify the exact Knowledge Element they are building
• Avoid adding new ideas not defined in the KE set
• Flag if they believe an unaddressed concept exists
• Submit content for validation before formatting
No one may arbitrarily add ideas to the system.
________________


9. Drift Detection Protocol
The architect checks for:
• Ideas recurring across Domains or Subtopics
• Content that “feels like” it belongs in another part of the architecture
• Newly invented concepts not grounded in existing Knowledge Elements
• Scope creep caused by examples bleeding into conceptual definitions
• Subtopics behaving like Domains
• Knowledge Elements behaving like Subtopics
If drift is detected:
• Stop production
• Return to the level where drift originated
• Restress test
• Correct the architecture
• Relock
Only then resume.
________________


10. Version Control
Each update to the architecture must include:
• A version number
• A change log
• A statement of what was added, moved, merged, or deleted
• A confirmation of which contributors were notified
This keeps the entire team aligned and prevents fragmentation.
________________


11. Monthly Architecture Review
Once per month (or at each major milestone):
• Review the entire Pillar or Sub-Pillar
• Look for accumulated drift
• Identify concepts that need restructuring before scaling
• Confirm alignment with TAC’s evolving strategic direction
If a structural correction is required, it must be executed before new content is added.
________________


12. AI Session Initialization Protocol
Every time AI is used for production:
• Load the TAC Architecture Guide
• Load the Quickstart Overview
• Load the HIP (Hierarchical Integrity Prompt)
• Paste the exact slice being worked on
• Explicitly restate the constraints
This guarantees consistency across sessions and prevents erosion of conceptual boundaries.
________________


13. Final Output Validation Before Publishing
Before any content enters Kajabi, Circle, or TAC platform:
• Confirm the meta-tag chain is correct
• Confirm content matches the atomic Knowledge Elements
• Confirm no new ideas are introduced
• Confirm correctness and adherence to TAC voice
Nothing goes live without architectural validation.

Summary
This workflow keeps TAC’s knowledge system:
• clean
• predictable
• scalable
• drift-resistant
• useful for learners
• usable by future GPT models
• and structurally consistent across hundreds of assets
It is the operator’s playbook.
No shortcuts.
No horizontal building until the architecture dictates it.
No content creation until the intellectual map is complete.
