The Only Correct Way to Build TAC With AI: 
Vertical, Sequential, Stress-Tested Expansion
If you want quality, coherence, and scalability, you must build the system vertically, not horizontally.
Meaning:
You never generate all Sub-Pillars at once.
You never generate all Branches at once.
You never try to fill out the entire architecture in a horizontal sweep.
That is where drift, overlap, and hallucination explode.
The method you naturally discovered – the way we built 7.2.3B-1.1 – is the correct method for the entire TAC system.
1. Why Vertical Is Mandatory
Your architecture is not a list.
It is a dependency tree.
Every level constrains the next level:
Pillar
→ shapes the Sub-Pillars
→ which shape the Branches
→ which shape the Topic Domains
→ which shape the Subtopics
→ which shape the Knowledge Elements.
If you fill things horizontally first (for example, all Sub-Pillars across all Pillars), you break the dependency chain. AI loses its constraints, starts mixing conceptual boundaries, and produces categories that don’t map cleanly.
Vertical building keeps the logic tight.
Horizontal building dissolves it.

2. The Vertical Method (The TAC Standard)
This is the method that yielded the flawless 7.2.3B-1.1 chain.
The sequence is:
Step 1: Fully finalize Sub-Pillar
Only when you can stress-test it and it survives.
Step 2: Fully finalize one Branch inside that Sub-Pillar
Not two.
Not three.
One.
Step 3: Fully finalize one Topic Domain inside that Branch
Stress test until clean.
Step 4: Fully finalize the Subtopics for that Domain
Step 5: Fully finalize Knowledge Elements for only one Subtopic
As we did with 7.2.3B-1.1.
Step 6: Stress test the hell out of it
Attack for overlap.
Attack for missing content.
Attack for scope violations.
Trim.
Add.
Reclassify.
Step 7: Lock it in before moving anywhere else
Step 8: Repeat for the next Subtopic, Domain, or Branch
Never expand outward until the vertical slice is perfect.
This keeps the architecture pure.

3. Why Horizontal Build Is Dangerous
You asked:
Should I try to produce all Sub-Pillars first?
All Branches first?
All Domains first?
No.
And here’s why.
AI drifts without constraints.
If you generate all Branches at once, AI invents categories that blur boundaries because it doesn’t yet understand:
• the true weight of the Sub-Pillar
• the intended relationship between Branches
• the nature of downstream Domains
• how these Branches will differentiate once drilled down
Result:
Branches overlap, drift, or contain premature specificity.
Same problem for Subtopics, Domains, or Knowledge Elements.
Horizontal expansion is how systems become incoherent.

4. The Hybrid Temptation (and why you must avoid it)
People often think:
“Maybe generate all Sub-Pillars, then drill down each vertically.”
Still wrong.
Because Sub-Pillars evolve once you drill into Branches.
Branch boundaries clarify once you drill into Domains.
Domains reveal their true size only once you hit Knowledge Elements.
Meaning:
Higher layers cannot be finalized until one deep slice is completed.
You need one fully developed “spine” to calibrate the rest of the architecture.
This is the same reason frameworks like ISO, medical ontologies, and legal taxonomies are developed with deep vertical exemplars before breadth.

5. The Correct Global Strategy for TAC
This is the recommended AI-driven build plan:
Phase 1: One full vertical slice per Pillar.
Exactly what we did for Pillar 7 → Sub-Pillar 7.2 → Branch 7.2.3B → Topic Domain 7.2.3B-1 → Subtopic 7.2.3B-1.1 → Knowledge Elements A–J.
This becomes the calibration spine for the entire Pillar.
Phase 2: After the first completed vertical slice, create a second vertical slice in another Branch.
This cross-validates the architecture and exposes hidden structural flaws.
Phase 3: Only when 2–3 vertical slices survive stress testing do you return to fill in the rest of the Pillar horizontally.
By then:
• your definitions are stable
• your category boundaries are crisp
• AI is fully calibrated
• the operating manual is in place
• drift risk drops dramatically
• human contributors understand the framework
Phase 4: Expand horizontally within the Pillar (Branches → Topic Domains → Subtopics).
Now it is safe.
Phase 5: Move to the next Pillar and repeat Phases 1–4.
This is EXACTLY how large-scale knowledge systems are built in medicine, academia, and ontology development.
It is slow at first, and then it explodes into speed.

6. Summary: The Optimal Strategy (If You Want Zero Drift)
Do not build horizontal first.
Do not try to populate entire high-level layers at once.
Do not allow AI to fill in broad structures without vertical constraints.
The correct approach is:
Vertical → Stress Test → Lock → Expand Laterally → Move Up/Down Carefully
This approach ensures:
• the model remains structurally pure
• every section is clear and non-overlapping
• subtopics are not invented prematurely
• knowledge elements are truly atomic
• the entire system remains scalable
• AI stays disciplined instead of hallucinating

Bottom Line
If TAC wants to build a once-in-a-generation knowledge system,
this is the only approach that works.
Vertical first.
Horizontal only after validation.
Stress test everything.
Lock each piece before expanding.
