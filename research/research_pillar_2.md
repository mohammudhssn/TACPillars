Pillar 2 Resesearch 
Domain 1: Anesthesia Provider Role Taxonomy and Classification

Overview: This domain catalogs all types of anesthesia providers and how they are classified. Major roles include the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), physician anesthesiologist (MD/DO), and anesthesiologist assistant (AA/CAA), along with students and trainees (e.g. SRNAs, anesthesia residents/fellows, AA students), and allied personnel (anesthesia technicians/technologists). Providers are often classified as independent practitioners (e.g. CRNAs, anesthesiologists) versus dependent practitioners (e.g. AAs, who require physician supervision). CRNAs are advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) with specialized anesthesia training
wiana.starchapter.com
, while physician anesthesiologists are medical doctors with anesthesia residency training
csa-online.org
. This taxonomy matters because each role has distinct scope and education requirements that determine team configuration and resource planning.

Key categories and components: Major provider categories include:

CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist): Advanced-practice nurse providing full anesthesia care; core member of anesthesia teams
wiana.starchapter.com
.

Physician Anesthesiologist (MD/DO): Medical doctor specialized in anesthesia, often team leader or sole provider
csa-online.org
.

Anesthesiologist Assistant (AA/CAA): Master’s-level anesthesia provider who always works under physician direction (cannot practice independently)
en.wikipedia.org
anesthetist.org
.

Students and Trainees: SRNAs (nurse anesthesia students), AA students, and anesthesiology residents/fellows; they have limited, supervised scope. For example, SRNAs practice only under supervision (often in a 2:1 student:instructor ratio
coacrna.org
) and cannot work independently. Residents (PGY-2/CA-1 through CA-3) gain progressive autonomy, culminating in independent management of many cases by senior years
anesthesia.bidmc.harvard.edu
.

Technicians/Technologists: Non-licensed support personnel who assist with equipment and basic procedures (outside provider scope).

Classification frameworks include the concept of Advanced Practice Provider (APP), under which CRNAs (and sometimes AAs) fall. Historically, nurse anesthetists have been termed “nurse anesthetists” or “nurse anesthesiologists,” while AAs were originally created in the 1960s to address physician shortages
en.wikipedia.org
. Internationally, roles vary: many countries have nurse anesthetists (often requiring a national diploma) and some are exploring physician-assistant–like anesthesia roles. For example, France requires a 2-year national diploma for nurse anesthetists
ifna.site
.

Governing bodies and standards: Role definitions are shaped by professional associations and accreditation bodies. In the U.S., the AANA sets standards for CRNA practice and education (COA accredits programs)
coacrna.org
, the ASA represents physician anesthesiologists and defines the anesthesia care team model
amnhealthcare.com
, and the NCCAA/AAAA governs AA certification and practice
anesthetist.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Internationally, groups like the International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists track global roles. Each provider must meet licensure and training requirements (e.g. state nursing or medical boards, NBCRNA certification, ABA certification).

Current state: In the U.S., there are ~49,000 CRNAs, ~40,000 physician anesthesiologists, and ~4,000 certified anesthesiologist assistants
ifna.site
anesthetist.org
. Many facilities use a mixed Anesthesia Care Team (ACT) model (physician plus CRNAs/AAs), but some employ independent models (all-CRNA or all-MD). Internationally, anesthesia teams vary: some countries rely solely on physicians, while others deploy nurse anesthetists or anesthesia assistants under varying scopes. Nurse anesthesia training and certification differ by country – e.g. the U.S. uses NBCRNA board exams and state APRN licensure, while France uses a national nursing diploma
ifna.site
. The U.S. calls CRNAs “APRNs” and includes them in advanced practice licensure systems, aligning them broadly with other advanced practice clinicians.

Emerging trends: New roles and classifications are evolving. The APRN multistate licensure compact (for NPs and CRNAs) was adopted in 2020 and will allow CRNAs to hold a single multistate license for practice across member states
comphealth.com
. There is growing recognition of CRNAs as independent providers in some federal and state contexts. Internationally, countries are considering or expanding non-physician anesthesia roles (e.g. “Anaesthesia Associates” in the UK, similar to AAs). The trend is toward formalizing team-based delivery (e.g. ACT models) while also expanding CRNA full-practice authority in rural or underserved areas. Workforce data (e.g. from IFNA) continue to monitor global supply and education levels of all provider categories
ifna.site
.

Key terminology: CRNA, APRN, MD/DO (physician anesthesiologist), Anesthesiologist Assistant (AA/CAA), Student Registered Nurse Anesthetist (SRNA), CA-1/2/3 (clinical anesthesia years), Fellowship (subspecialty training), ACT (Anesthesia Care Team), APP (Advanced Practice Provider), Scope of Practice, Privilege Delineation, Credentialing.

Domain 2: CRNA Role — Definition, Competencies, and Practice Scope

Overview: The Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) is an advanced-practice nurse specialized in anesthesia. CRNAs are defined as APRNs licensed to provide anesthesia care for all patients across the lifespan
wiana.starchapter.com
. Their education and certification equip them to autonomously administer anesthesia, analgesia, and related care. Understanding the CRNA role and scope is crucial for curriculum development and for delineating how CRNAs function in healthcare teams.

Key categories and components:

Formal role definition: CRNAs are APRNs who independently plan and deliver anesthesia and analgesia
wiana.starchapter.com
. They are trained to manage perioperative care for surgical, obstetric, trauma, and pain procedures, and they may serve as primary anesthesia providers or team members.

Core competencies: Clinical competencies include preoperative assessment, anesthetic planning, airway management (intubation, ventilation), regional blockade, sedation, monitoring, resuscitation, and postoperative pain control. CRNAs also have non-clinical competencies in patient advocacy, leadership, education, and quality improvement
wiana.starchapter.com
. AANA standards emphasize safe practice, evidence-based care, and continuous competency maintenance.

Scope of practice: CRNA scope covers virtually all anesthesia services: general, regional, obstetric, trauma, pediatric, pain management, and sedation in various settings (OR, OB, ICU, radiology, etc.)
wiana.starchapter.com
. CRNAs routinely place invasive lines (arterial, central venous), perform advanced airway procedures, and manage hemodynamics. They can prescribe non-controlled medications (with NP/PA credentialing if applicable) and, in many states, controlled substances for pain. CRNAs also engage in patient safety activities, education (teaching students), administration, and research. The AANA explicitly states that CRNAs “provide all types of anesthesia-related care” and serve as leaders and educators
wiana.starchapter.com
wiana.starchapter.com
.

Clinical domains: By training, CRNAs manage general anesthesia, regional anesthesia (nerve and neuraxial blocks), moderate and deep sedation, obstetric anesthesia (labor and cesarean analgesia), pain management techniques, and critical care support during emergencies. Non-anesthetic duties (e.g. code response, ICU care) are also within their practiced competence in many institutions.

Limitations and boundaries: A CRNA’s scope in practice is bounded by state law, facility policies, and their education. By professional definition, however, CRNAs are prepared to handle complex cases independently
wiana.starchapter.com
. Supervision requirements vary, but CRNAs maintain accountability for their judgment and are expected to consult a physician for patient management issues beyond their training. CRNA privilege documents typically require documentation of qualifications and competencies (e.g. licensure, COA-accredited education, certification
canainc.org
).

AANA position: The AANA’s Scope of Practice statement affirms that CRNAs “exercise independent judgment” and “are accountable for their actions” in providing anesthesia care
wiana.starchapter.com
. This document underscores that CRNAs should have privileges consistent with their advanced training and that their practice encompasses all anesthesia services.

Governing bodies and standards: The CRNA role is governed by the Council on Accreditation (COA) and NBCRNA for education and certification, and by state Boards of Nursing for licensure. The AANA provides professional standards and scope definitions
wiana.starchapter.com
. The COA’s accreditation standards (now doctorate entry level) specify curriculum and competency requirements. Hospitals credential CRNAs based on state RN/APRN licensure, national certification (NBCRNA), and demonstrated competencies
canainc.org
. The DEA and state pharmacies license CRNAs for prescribing.

Current state: Today, CRNAs practice in every U.S. state and across all types of healthcare facilities. They administer over 43 million anesthetics annually
ifna.site
. In many rural and military settings, CRNAs are the sole anesthesia providers. In urban hospitals, CRNAs often work in ACT models or independently under protocol. They treat patients of all ages and comorbidities. CRNAs’ full scope includes advanced airway management, epidurals/spinals, block placements, intraoperative management, and ICU-level resuscitation. They also serve in leadership roles (e.g. anesthesia directors, quality officers). Compared to physician anesthesiologists, CRNAs’ scope overlaps greatly, though MDAs also perform certain subspecialty roles (e.g. pediatric critical care, pain fellowships). CRNAs are licensed as APRNs, and their national certification (via the NBCRNA NCE) verifies readiness for full scope practice
nbcrna.com
.

Emerging trends: The CRNA role continues to expand in autonomy and settings. The uniform requirement of a doctoral degree (DNP or DNAP) for entry by 2022 has been met
ifna.site
, reflecting rising educational standards. There is growth in CRNA-led care models (e.g. CRNA-only departments) and in federal recognition of their independent practice (e.g. VA fully recognizes CRNAs’ full scope). Interprofessional models emphasize the CRNA as a perioperative provider alongside MDAs. Telemedicine is beginning to allow anesthetic care consultation across distances, potentially extending CRNA practice reach. Continuing education requirements (CPC program) and competency modules ensure CRNAs maintain up-to-date practice. Research and leadership roles for CRNAs are growing, as is CRNA involvement in policy (e.g. advocating for full practice authority).

Key terminology: APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurse), Scope of Practice, Provider Privileges, DNP/DNAP (Doctorate of Nursing Anesthesia), COA (Council on Accreditation), NBCRNA (National Board of Certification and Recertification for Nurse Anesthetists), NCE (National Certification Examination), CPC (Continued Professional Certification), Anesthesia Care Team (ACT), Autonomous Practice, Provider-to-Instructor Ratio (for SRNAs)

Domain 3: Physician Anesthesiologist Role — Definition and Practice Model

Overview: The physician anesthesiologist is a medical doctor (MD or DO) who specializes in perioperative medicine and anesthesia care. This role is defined by completion of medical school and an accredited anesthesiology residency, and often additional fellowship training in subspecialties. Anesthesiologists serve as the team leaders in perioperative planning, patient optimization, and intra-/post-operative management
csa-online.org
. Understanding their role and training pathway is critical for delineating team functions and training needs.

Key categories and components:

Definition and training pathway: An anesthesiologist completes undergraduate education, 4 years of medical school, and 3-4 years of anesthesiology residency training (American residency programs typically include a 1-year internship followed by 3 years of clinical anesthesia training). Many also pursue subspecialty fellowships (e.g. cardiac, pediatric, obstetric, pain, critical care, neuroanesthesia) after residency. Some programs offer combined or accelerated pathways (e.g. 3-year routes, combined internal medicine-anesthesia tracks). Training emphasizes advanced physiology, pharmacology, airway management, pain management, and critical care. During residency, trainees take In-Training Exams and certification steps (e.g. ABA BASIC exam after CA-1 year)
theaba.org
.

Core competencies and scope: Physician anesthesiologists have broad competencies in physiology and resuscitation, enabling them to manage complex medical conditions in surgical patients. Their clinical scope covers all types of anesthesia care (similar to CRNAs) but also includes independent practice of high-acuity and subspecialty procedures (e.g. cardiac anesthesia, major neuro cases). They also practice intensive care and chronic pain medicine outside the operating room. ASA emphasizes the anesthesiologist as the “perioperative physician,” responsible for preoperative assessment and optimization, intraoperative anesthesia management, and postoperative care
csa-online.org
.

Medical direction vs. supervision: Anesthesiologists can function in an anesthesia care team, providing medical direction to up to four concurrent nurse anesthetists (1:4 ratio)
aana.com
amnhealthcare.com
. To do so, they must perform the 7 required activities (pre-anesthetic evaluation, plan prescription, induction/emergence involvement, monitoring, and postoperative care)
aana.com
. If an anesthesiologist manages more than four cases concurrently, this is termed medical supervision (with more limited direct involvement)
aana.com
amnhealthcare.com
. These billing-based definitions shape how teams are organized, but in practice anesthesiologists decide how to deploy their oversight.

Subspecialization: After residency, anesthesiologists may undertake fellowships in critical care medicine, pain management, pediatric anesthesia, adult cardiac anesthesia, obstetric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, regional anesthesia/acute pain, etc. These fellowship-trained physicians focus on niche domains (e.g. pediatric anesthesiologist in children’s hospitals) and often staff specialized units. The ABA administers Basic (to exit CA-1), Advanced (to exit residency) and Applied (for subspecialty) certification exams
theaba.org
theaba.org
. Ongoing certification (MOCA) ensures maintenance of competencies throughout their career.

Practice settings: Anesthesiologists work in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, military, and physician offices (pain clinics). In academic settings they teach residents and conduct research; in community/private practice they may cover multiple hospitals or group practices. They often direct anesthesia departments, set policies, and implement quality/safety programs. Many also assume leadership roles in critical care units (ICUs).

Governing bodies and standards: The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and ACGME set professional standards for physician anesthesiologists. The ASA defines the perioperative role and endorses ACT models
amnhealthcare.com
. ACGME accredits residency programs and enforces competency-based requirements (milestones in patient care, medical knowledge, etc.). The American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) governs certification – requiring completion of initial exams (BASIC, ADVANCED) and continuing certification (MOCA) as detailed above
theaba.org
theaba.org
. Hospitals credential anesthesiologists through medical staff bylaws, requiring state medical licensure (MD/DO license) and board certification, and define specific privileges (e.g. high-risk patients, subspecialty blocks).

Current state: Anesthesiologists serve as the “gold standard” perioperative physicians. They carry the ultimate responsibility for anesthesia care plans, and in many models provide medical direction to non-physician providers. In ACT settings, anesthesiologists lead teams and supervise CRNAs/AAs, ensuring high-level expertise is available. The 1:4 direction ratio is well established
amnhealthcare.com
. In private practice, anesthesiologists may work solo (especially if no CRNAs are available), while many hospitals blend both roles. Anesthesiologists routinely engage in critical care rounds, manage complex resuscitations, and consult on high-risk surgical cases.

Emerging trends: The anesthesiologist’s role is evolving toward a broader perioperative focus. Concepts like the “perioperative surgical home” envision anesthesiologists coordinating care from pre-op to post-op, partnering with surgeons and teams. There is growth in anesthesiologist involvement in pain clinics and outpatient procedures. Some anesthesiology programs now include management training for leadership roles. In the context of ACT, the trend is to optimize team care models for efficiency and patient safety – for example, leveraging anesthesiologist expertise for complicated parts of cases while delegating routine aspects to CRNAs or AAs. Globally, anesthesiology training standards continue to rise (e.g. extended training programs in some countries) and collaboration with other specialties (like hospitalists) is increasing.

Key terminology: Physician Anesthesiologist (MD/DO), Residency (CA‑1/2/3 years), Fellowship (subspecialty training), Medical Direction, Medical Supervision, ABA Certification (BASIC, ADVANCED, APPLIED), Maintenance of Certification (MOCA), ACGME, ASA Guidelines, Perioperative Physician, ACT (Anesthesia Care Team).

Domain 4: Anesthesiologist Assistant Role — Definition and Scope

Overview: An Anesthesiologist Assistant (AA), or Certified Anesthesiologist Assistant (CAA), is a non-physician anesthesia provider trained at the master’s level. AAs function exclusively on anesthesia care teams under the direction of physician anesthesiologists. They extend the care of anesthesiologists by performing many clinical anesthesia tasks, but they cannot practice independently. This domain covers who AAs are, how they train and are certified, and the limits of their scope.

Key categories and components:

Definition and training: CAAs are highly-educated medical professionals who administer anesthesia care as part of a team led by an anesthesiologist
anesthetist.org
. AA programs typically admit college graduates (often with premed science background) and last ~24–28 months, culminating in a Master’s degree
en.wikipedia.org
. Admission requirements include a bachelor’s degree and health care experience (often minimal; some programs require observation hours)
en.wikipedia.org
. During training, AA students complete didactic courses (physiology, pharmacology, airway management, ACLS/PALS certification) and extensive clinical rotations (2000–2700 hours of anesthesia cases
en.wikipedia.org
). By graduation, AA students have been supervised by physician anesthesiologists in delivering anesthesia in a wide range of cases.

Certification (NCCAA): Graduates of CAAHEP-accredited AA programs must pass a national exam administered by the NCCAA (National Commission for Certification of Anesthesiologist Assistants) in conjunction with the NBME
en.wikipedia.org
. NCCAA certification is required for state licensure. AAs must then maintain certification through continuing medical education and periodic examinations. The NCCAA ensures that certified AAs meet standards of knowledge and clinical competency.

Scope of practice: AAs are trained to administer all types of anesthesia (general, regional, sedation) in any setting, but always under direct anesthesiologist supervision. In practice, an anesthesiologist and AA work together: the physician formulates the plan and handles critical tasks, while the AA implements parts of the anesthetic and monitors the patient
en.wikipedia.org
. Common AA duties include obtaining patient histories, placing monitoring lines, administering anesthesia drugs, and responding to emergencies (e.g. codes) per the anesthesiologist’s directives
en.wikipedia.org
. Because AAs are never autonomous, their scope is strictly defined by the supervising physician’s orders and institutional policies.

States and practice settings: CAAs are authorized to practice in a limited number of U.S. jurisdictions (approximately 22 states, DC and Guam)
en.wikipedia.org
. They work in ACT models, VA hospitals, academic centers, and private practices where anesthesiologists lead care. No “independent” AA practice exists; if more than one AA is present, each must still be directed by an anesthesiologist. In federal facilities (VA/DoD), federal recognition of AAs allows them to practice in those systems.

Comparison to CRNAs: Structurally, AAs perform many similar tasks to CRNAs (anesthesia case management, line placement, etc.), but unlike CRNAs, AAs are always dependent on physician supervision. CRNAs are trained as nurses and can practice independently or in teams; AAs have physician-focused training and must have an anesthesiologist present
anesthetist.org
anesthetist.org
.

NCCAA and AAAA: The NCCAA (National Commission on Certification of AAs) governs AA certification. The professional association (AAAA) advocates for the role. There is no equivalent of a medical board for AAs; regulation is through state medical boards or agencies that oversee physician assistants.

Governing bodies and standards: AA programs are accredited by CAAHEP (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs) via the ARC-AA. The NCCAA sets certification standards. Physician supervision standards come from federal and state guidelines (e.g. CMS, state medical boards) but are beyond Pillar 2 scope. The AAAA produces practice standards and collects workforce data. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) formally recognizes AAs as part of ACT models (though ASA does not support their independent expansion).

Current state: There are about 23 CAA programs in the U.S. (master’s-level) and roughly 4,000 practicing AAs
anesthetist.org
. The practice is concentrated in the eastern U.S. and in academic health centers. In practice, anesthesiologists may direct or supervise a team of one or more AAs (up to 4 concurrent under direction). The anesthesiologist leads the case with AAs performing delegated tasks. Some larger practices may have multiple anesthesiologist-AA teams. The availability of AAs is far smaller than CRNAs, so in many places only CRNAs or anesthesiologists are used.

Emerging trends: AA roles remain relatively static geographically, but interest is rising in some states to authorize their practice (balanced by opposition in others). Educationally, AA programs continue to expand (new programs added) and maintain rigorous standards. There is discussion of integrating more critical care or pediatric rotations given anesthesiologist needs. As healthcare moves toward team-based care, the AA role is often mentioned in workforce planning. However, debate continues over AA utilization; some advocate for expanded use under ACT models for access and cost reasons, while others (especially in nursing circles) resist expanding dependent roles.

Key terminology: Anesthesiologist Assistant (AA/CAA), NCCAA (certifying commission), AAAA (professional association), CME (continuing medical education), Supervising Anesthesiologist, ACT (Anesthesia Care Team), CAAHEP (accreditation body), Dependent Practitioner, NBME (National Board of Medical Examiners).

Domain 5: Student and Trainee Role Definitions

Overview: This domain covers the status and limitations of anesthesia trainees – those in formal education programs on the path to becoming providers. It includes Student Registered Nurse Anesthetists (SRNAs), anesthesiology residents and fellows, and anesthesiologist assistant (AA) students. These roles are provisional and always involve supervision; they are not independent practitioners. Understanding trainee roles is vital for curriculum design and for defining what trainees are permitted to do under supervision.

Key categories and components:

SRNA (Student Registered Nurse Anesthetist): A registered nurse in a nurse anesthesia graduate program. SRNAs are not licensed as CRNAs and can only provide anesthesia care under the direct supervision of a qualified CRNA or anesthesiologist. They participate in didactic classes, simulation, and clinical cases as part of their training. Regulatory standards (COA) limit the student-to-instructor ratio (no more than 2 SRNAs to 1 instructor
coacrna.org
) to ensure close oversight. An SRNA may gradually take on more responsibility (e.g. pre-induction tasks, post-op care) as they progress, but always with supervision. Many states issue SRNAs a temporary permit to practice under supervision until they pass the national certification exam. SRNAs cannot independently make anesthesia decisions or bill for services; they help in provision of care under guidance.

Anesthesiology residents: Physicians in training (MD/DO) within accredited anesthesia residency programs. Most U.S. programs have a 1-year internship (often PGY-1) followed by 3 years of anesthesia clinical training (CA-1, CA-2, CA-3). Intern year residents do general medicine, then from CA-1 onward focus on anesthesia. With each year, residents take on more autonomy: early on they assist and manage routine cases under close supervision; by CA-2/3 they often manage cases with an attending available by phone, stepping in for critical moments
anesthesia.bidmc.harvard.edu
. Residents do rotations in subspecialties (pediatric, OB, cardiac, ICU, pain). Fellowship trainees are physicians who have completed residency and seek extra subspecialty training; they perform advanced roles in their focus area (e.g. pediatric anesthesia fellow in children’s OR).

AA student (Anesthesiologist Assistant student): A trainee in a CAAHEP-accredited AA program. Like SRNAs, AA students have defined clinical experiences but must always be supervised by a physician anesthesiologist (and often a program mentor) during cases. They complete the curriculum and clinical requirements (also often around 2000 hours of anesthesia exposure
en.wikipedia.org
) but without independent practice rights until after graduation and certification.

Provisional credentials: While in training, SRNAs and AA students do not hold the full credentials of their future roles. States may issue temporary practice permits or certificates for SRNAs (pending certification) and AA graduates (pending exam). Residents and fellows have medical trainee privileges through the hospital credentialing process, tied to their training program, and they act under attending physicians’ licenses. Moonlighting (extra shifts for pay) by senior residents or fellows is sometimes allowed by programs under strict rules; SRNAs rarely moonlight except in certain CRNA-program-affiliated roles.

International trainees: Other countries have analogous trainees (e.g. nurse anesthetist trainees in Europe often have specific titles). Globally, anesthesia trainees (whether nursing or medical) typically follow supervised incremental responsibility similar to U.S. models.

Governing bodies and standards: Educational oversight bodies set rules for trainees. In the U.S., the COA sets supervision rules for SRNAs in nurse anesthesia programs (e.g. clinical ratios, competencies)
coacrna.org
. The ACGME sets requirements for anesthesia residency programs, including progressive autonomy and supervision policies. Hospitals grant “Trainee” or “Fellow” privileges under their medical staff bylaws. The NBCRNA allows SRNAs to sit for the NCE after program completion.

Current state: SRNAs nationwide complete rigorous accredited programs (master’s/DNP level) that include didactic hours and a COA-mandated minimum of 2,000 clinical hours
coacrna.org
. They graduate and then take the NBCRNA exam to become CRNAs. Residents complete in-training exams and ABA certification steps (e.g. BASIC exam after CA-1) as part of their progression. Fellows typically earn subspecialty board certification after fellowship (e.g. ABA critical care exam). Trainees generally cannot sign independent orders, and supervision responsibility rests with faculty or preceptors.

Emerging trends: Anesthesia education is increasingly competency-based. Simulation and milestone assessments (ACGME) guide progressive independence. For CRNA education, the move to 100% doctoral-level programs (DNP) has been completed, raising academic standards for SRNAs. Interprofessional training (e.g. CRNA students and anesthesia residents learning together) is a growing concept in some institutions. Pandemic-driven licensing flexibilities (e.g. expedited SRNA exam timelines) have recently affected trainee progression, though full details lie in policy space. Tele-supervision models (e.g. remote attending oversight of trainees) are also being explored.

Key terminology: SRNA (Student Registered Nurse Anesthetist), Resident (PGY-2 through PGY-4/CA1–CA3), Fellow (subspecialty trainee), AA Student, Supervision Ratio (e.g. 2:1)
coacrna.org
, Clinical Privileges (Trainee vs Independent), In-Training Exam, BASIC Exam, Self-Evaluation Exam (SEE), First Assist (in surgery), Provisional License/Permit.

Domain 6: Training Pathway Architecture and Entry Requirements

Overview: This domain outlines the educational and experiential pathways that prepare individuals for each anesthesia provider role. It covers prerequisites, program structures, and timelines for CRNAs, physician anesthesiologists, and AAs. Understanding entry requirements and program architectures is essential for prospective students and curriculum planners.

Key categories and components:

CRNA pathway: Typically requires (1) a bachelor’s degree in nursing (BSN) or equivalent, (2) licensure as an RN, and (3) critical care experience (usually ≥1 year in an ICU)
ifna.site
. Many programs prefer or require certification like CCRN. CRNA programs (COA-accredited) include graduate-level didactic courses and clinical rotations. Programs last ~24–36 months (some longer); they award a master’s or now doctorate (DNP/DNAP) degree
ifna.site
. All programs now require doctoral-level preparation by 2022
ifna.site
. Admission may require a minimum GPA (often ~3.0–3.2) and may include GRE scores (though this is fading). Students complete roughly 2000 hours/600 cases of clinical anesthesia
coacrna.org
nbcrna.com
. After graduation, candidates are eligible for the NBCRNA certification exam (NCE)
nbcrna.com
. Total time: ~6–8 years post-secondary (4-year BSN + ICU + 2–3 year program).

Physician pathway (MD/DO anesthesiologist): Requires (1) a 4-year undergraduate degree (any major, with pre-med prerequisites) and (2) medical school (4 years, MD or DO). Medical school admission is competitive (MCAT exam, GPA). After medical school, one enters an anesthesiology residency: typically a 1-year internship (transitional or categorical prelim year in medicine or surgery) followed by 3 years of clinical anesthesiology training (CA-1 to CA-3)
theaba.org
. Some programs integrate 4 years of anesthesiology directly. Graduates are eligible for ABA Basic and Advanced exams
theaba.org
. Optionally, physicians may then train 1–2 additional years in a subspecialty fellowship. Total time: ~10–12 years post-secondary.

AA pathway: Requires (1) a bachelor’s degree (often with a science focus) and (2) admission to a CAAHEP-accredited AA program. Many programs prefer some healthcare experience or observation hours (e.g. ~8 hrs OR observation
en.wikipedia.org
). AA programs last about 24–28 months
en.wikipedia.org
 and lead to a master’s degree in anesthesia. Like CRNA programs, they include didactic coursework and 2,000–2,700 clinical hours
en.wikipedia.org
. All students must complete the curriculum within their scope. After graduation, they take the NBME/NCCAA exam for certification
en.wikipedia.org
. Total time: ~6–7 years post-secondary (4-year college + 2–2.5 year program).

Clinical requirements: For CRNAs, the COA requires a minimum of 2,000 hours of clinical anesthesia experience in program
coacrna.org
. Similarly, AA students complete comparable clinical hours (~2,000–2,700)
en.wikipedia.org
. Physician residents have case minimums mandated by ACGME and ABA (e.g. hundreds of cases logged by graduation) – these are typically greater than 1,000 cases over residency.

Degree requirements: The CRNA profession has transitioned to requiring doctoral degrees (DNP or DNAP) for new graduates
ifna.site
. Anesthesiologists earn an MD or DO and may pursue additional academic degrees (e.g. MPH, PhD). AAs earn a Master of Science or Master of Medical Science in Anesthesia.

Time-to-practice comparison: Roughly, CRNAs spend ~6–8 years (BSN + ICU + grad program), anesthesiologists ~10–12 years (undergrad + med school + residency), and AAs ~6–7 years (undergrad + AA program).

Cost of training: CRNA programs often involve tuition costs (tens of thousands) and sometimes paid clinical stipends. Medical school is expensive (often >$200k debt), but residents earn a salary during residency. AA programs may offer assistantships or salaries. (Detailed financials are beyond Pillar 2 scope.)

International pathways: Abroad, entry pathways vary. For example, in France a registered nurse enters a 2-year specialized anesthesia program to become a nurse anesthetist
ifna.site
. In some countries, physicians may complete anesthesia as a 5+ year specialty training directly out of medical school. For globally mobile learners, equivalencies and credential recognition depend on local regulations.

Alternative routes: Some physicians take an “alternate route” to anesthesia certification (e.g. combined internal medicine-anesthesia programs), and there are programs that allow non-nurses (e.g. paramedics) to transition to CRNA in some jurisdictions. Military programs also train nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists in specialized tracks. Second-career entries (e.g. CRNAs who later enter medical school, or vice versa) require meeting both sets of prerequisites.

Governing bodies and standards: Educational pathways are regulated by accreditation bodies. COA specifies CRNA program curricula and entry requirements (published in COA Standards). ACGME sets requirements for anesthesiology residencies (e.g. minimum rotations). CAAHEP (ARC-AA) sets standards for AA programs. Each program must meet these standards, including faculty qualifications, didactic hours, simulation, and clinical experience metrics. Entrance criteria (e.g. ICU hours for SRNAs, observation for AAs) are set by program policies aligned with accrediting requirements.

Current state: CRNA programs have largely converged on requiring at least 1 year (often 2) of ICU experience and competitive GPA
ifna.site
. Residency programs are uniform in requiring standardized exams (USMLE/COMLEX) and match processes. AA programs uniformly require a bachelor’s and have grown to 23 programs nationally. The trend toward doctoral CRNA entry is complete. Distance education (online coursework) is increasingly used for CRNA didactics within COA guidelines, and blended clinical rotations remain hands-on. Fellowships in nurse anesthesia (post-CRNA) also exist for advanced practice or research specialization.

Emerging trends: Educational prerequisites are rising (e.g. more programs prefer CCRN certification for applicants). Competency-based training (entrustable professional activities) is being discussed across all paths. For anesthesiologists, 3-year residency tracks and 1-year clinical anesthesia paths are becoming more common. For CRNAs, accelerated programs (for those with non-nursing degrees or OR experience) are rare but mentioned. The APRN compact (once in force) will affect mobility of trainees and practicing CRNAs. Simulation technology is increasingly integrated into training across roles.

Key terminology: Prerequisites, COA (Council on Accreditation), ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Med Ed), CAAHEP (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Programs), ICU Experience, Case Minimums, Doctorate (DNP/DNAP), Residency (CA1–CA3), Fellowship, Match Process, USMLE/COMLEX, Simulation Hours, Program Director, Clinical Rotation.

Domain 7: Program Accreditation and Educational Standards

Overview: This domain addresses the accrediting bodies and standards that govern anesthesia education programs. Accreditation ensures consistency and quality of training for CRNAs, physician anesthesiologists, and AAs. It defines educational objectives, faculty qualifications, curricula, clinical experiences, and outcome requirements. All anesthesia training programs must be accredited by the appropriate agency to be recognized as valid.

Key categories and components:

Nurse anesthesia programs (CRNAs): Accredited by the COA. COA publishes Standards for Accreditation (recently updated for the practice doctorate era)
coacrna.org
. Key elements include faculty credentials (minimum doctorally-prepared faculty by 2022), curriculum content (AANA Essentials topics), clinical site requirements, simulation training, scholarship/faculty development, and student outcomes. Programs must demonstrate sufficient clinical case volume, appropriate clinical preceptors, and program resources (financing, space) for their declared class size
coacrna.org
coacrna.org
. COA requires programs to produce outcome data (graduation rates, exam pass rates, employment rates). Programs failing outcome thresholds (e.g. <80% NBCRNA exam pass rate) are placed on monitoring or warned
coacrna.org
. COA conducts site visits (self-study, on-site review by trained peers) for initial accreditation and periodic re-accreditation (e.g. full review after 5 years of first class)
coacrna.org
coacrna.org
. COA also accredits CRNA fellowships with separate standards.

Anesthesiology residencies (MD/DO): Accredited by the ACGME. The ACGME Anesthesiology Review Committee sets Program Requirements, including faculty-to-resident ratios, didactic curricula, clinical rotations, case minimums (surgical and ICU cases), and wellness standards. ACGME also defines the 6 core competencies and Milestones framework for resident evaluation. Programs undergo accreditation site visits and annual program evaluations. Graduates must come from an ACGME-accredited program to sit for ABA certification exams. ACGME recently integrated DO residency accreditation under its umbrella as well.

Anesthesiologist Assistant programs: Accredited by CAAHEP via the ARC-AA. CAAHEP standards require a master’s curriculum, clinical practicum, faculty oversight (including board-certified anesthesiologists on faculty), and outcomes assessment. All AA programs must maintain CAAHEP accreditation for graduates to be eligible for NCCAA certification
en.wikipedia.org
.

Outcome metrics and quality: Accreditation bodies mandate programs track outcomes. For example, COA standards include minimum exam pass rates (typically 80%)
coacrna.org
, attrition/dropout rates, and job placement. CAAHEP similarly monitors graduate success on certification exams. ACGME evaluates residency outcomes by board exam pass rates and resident performance on the ABA BASIC/ADVANCED exams. Accreditation reviews consider these data.

Faculty and curriculum standards: Nurse anesthesia standards require faculty with terminal degrees (DNP/PhD) for instruction in research and higher-order content, and enough faculty for clinical oversight. ACGME requires core faculty with board certification in anesthesiology. Both disciplines mandate continuing faculty development. COA requires instruction in topics like patient safety, quality improvement, evidence-based practice; ACGME requires didactics in related topics (e.g. ACLS, PALS, simulation, professionalism).

Clinical site requirements: COA mandates agreements with hospitals providing case variety (e.g. OB, pediatrics, critical care) for student experiences
coacrna.org
. ACGME mandates enough clinical volume and diversity to meet case minimums and learning goals. Both bodies encourage interprofessional training environments.

Governing bodies and standards: The COA (Council on Accreditation) is responsible for CRNA program accreditation
coacrna.org
. ACGME accredits anesthesiology residencies. CAAHEP/ARC-AA accredits AA programs (ARC-AA is the review committee for AAs). These agencies derive their authority from recognition by the U.S. Department of Education or CHEA. They publish Standards and Policies manuals that programs must follow
coacrna.org
. Programs undergo regular review cycles (initial, provisional, continuing accreditation). Failure to meet standards can result in probation or withdrawal of accreditation.

Current state: Most existing CRNA programs and all anesthesiology residencies are fully accredited under current standards. In 2022, CRNA programs switched to all being doctorate-level (meeting COA’s DNP requirement)
ifna.site
. Hybrid (distance) programs exist, with COA allowing significant online didactic content as long as clinical training is in person. ACGME residency standards have recently increased emphasis on resident well-being and diversity. New AA programs must receive CAAHEP accreditation before enrolling students. Outcome monitoring is active: for instance, a CRNA program missing board pass requirements is put on monitoring
coacrna.org
. Accrediting bodies also provide guidance on emerging topics (e.g. simulation hours, clinical competencies).

Emerging trends: Accreditation is shifting toward competency-based evaluation. COA encourages inclusion of entrustable professional activities and simulation in curricula. There is more emphasis on interprofessional education in standards. The ACGME and ABA are exploring longitudinal assessment tools beyond high-stakes exams (e.g. MOCA Minute questions). Accreditation bodies are also addressing non-traditional program formats (e.g. multi-institution programs, expanded distance learning) and clarifying standards for them. Enhanced outcomes tracking (via dashboards) and greater transparency (publishing program data) are trends. New program development (both CRNA and AA) requires meeting stringent standards upfront, so bodies are refining processes for program approval.

Key terminology: Accreditation, COA (Council on Accreditation), ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education), CAAHEP/ARC-AA, Program Requirements, Standards, Self-study, Site Visit, Outcomes Assessment, Probation/Monitoring, Simulation, Entrustable Professional Activities, Case Minimums, Certification Pass Rate, Faculty Qualifications

Domain 8: National Certification Systems

Overview: This domain covers the national certification and recertification processes for anesthesia providers. Certification validates that a provider has met minimum knowledge and skill standards. For CRNAs, certification is by the NBCRNA; for physician anesthesiologists, by the ABA; and for AAs, by the NCCAA. Each board’s exams and continuing certification requirements ensure practitioners maintain competence.

Key categories and components:

CRNA Certification (NBCRNA): After completing a COA-accredited program, CRNA candidates take the National Certification Examination (NCE). The NCE consists of a minimum of 100 graded questions (70 content-based, 30 pilot/unscored) in anesthesia science and practice
nbcrna.com
. Passing yields initial CRNA certification. There is also a voluntary Self-Evaluation Exam (SEE) for candidates and students to assess readiness. For maintenance, the NBCRNA’s Continued Professional Certification (CPC) program (in place through 2025) requires 100 credits every 4 years: 60 Class A (approved CE), 40 Class B (professional activities), plus completion of four Core Modules on emerging practice topics and a CPC assessment
nbcrna.com
. A CPC two-year check-in verifies license and practice status. In 2026, NBCRNA will transition to a new Maintenance of Certification (MAC) model, aligning with other boards. NBCRNA also offers (separate from core CRNA role) a Pain Management certification exam for CRNAs.

Physician Certification (ABA): After residency, anesthesiologists pursue ABA certification. The ABA’s initial certification has three parts:

BASIC Exam: Taken after CA-1 (end of PGY-2); focuses on basic sciences (pharmacology, physiology, anesthesia physics)
theaba.org
.

ADVANCED Exam: Taken after residency (post CA-3); focuses on clinical anesthesia and subspecialty topics
theaba.org
.

APPLIED Exam: Consists of an oral exam (Standardized Oral Exam) and an Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) in advanced/practice situations
theaba.org
.
After passing all parts, the physician is ABA-certified. For subspecialties (e.g. pediatric anesthesiology), ABA administers Additional “Subspecialty Exams”. To maintain certification, diplomates participate in Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology (MOCA), which involves periodic assessments (annual MOCA Minute questions, continuing education, etc.)
theaba.org
. The ABA also allows diplomates to satisfy MOC through traditional continuing medical education and clinical practice requirements.

AA Certification (NCCAA): Graduates of accredited AA programs take a credentialing exam co-validated by the NBME and administered by the NCCAA
en.wikipedia.org
. Passing grants a time-limited certificate. To recertify, AAs complete CME and a Continued Demonstration of Qualifications (exam) every 6 years (40 hours CME biennially, periodic exam). The NCCAA certifies AAs in all states where they practice.

Certification vs. Licensure: Certification is national and voluntary (though required for practice), while licensure is state-specific. Passing certification exams makes providers eligible for state licenses (e.g. APRN license for CRNAs, medical license for anesthesiologists, physician assistant license for AAs). Certification bodies (NBCRNA, ABA, NCCAA) are not government agencies but are recognized by boards.

Eligibility requirements: NBCRNA candidates must graduate from an accredited CRNA program and report required clinical cases
nbcrna.com
. ABA candidates must complete an accredited residency and in-training requirements. AA candidates must graduate from an accredited AA master’s program
en.wikipedia.org
.

Governing bodies and standards: The NBCRNA sets exam content and CPC policy under standards recognized by nursing boards. The ABA (American Board of Anesthesiology, an ABMS member) sets exam blueprints and MOC requirements. The NCCAA sets AA certification standards. All follow testing guidelines for exam security and validity. These organizations collaborate with or report to professional societies (AANA, ASA, AAAA) but are independent examiners.

Current state: CRNAs achieve certification via the NCE (pass rates typically >90%). Those renewing under the CPC must complete core modules (e.g. evidence-based practice, quality) and required credits
nbcrna.com
. Physician anesthesiologists increasingly use the MOCA program for maintenance. AAs hold NCCAA certificates; their re-certification (MOCA for AAs) is akin to physician practice hours. The overall trend is toward continuous competency verification (moving away from one-time lifetime certification). For CRNAs, the upcoming MAC program will replace CPC. For AAs, continuing ed and periodic exams remain.

Emerging trends: Certification systems are shifting toward more longitudinal assessment. The NBCRNA’s MAC program will add a new assessment component (a time-limited exam) starting in 2026. The ABA is rolling out a Transition to Practice curriculum and exploring online continuing assessment. There is also discussion in professional circles of reciprocal recognition or “mobility” of credentials across roles (though nothing formal exists). Interprofessional certification (e.g. anesthesia subspecialty certification available to CRNAs in areas like pain?) is not currently standard but being explored by some boards.

Key terminology: NBCRNA (certification board for CRNAs), NCE (National Certification Exam), CPC (Continued Professional Certification), Core Modules, Class A/B Credits, ABA (American Board of Anesthesiology), BASIC/ADVANCED/APPLIED Exams, MOCA (Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology), NCCAA (certification body for AAs), Initial vs. Continuing Certification, Eligibility, Pass Rate, ABA In-Training Exam, Oral Exam (SOE).

Domain 9: Licensure and Institutional Credentialing

Overview: Licensure and credentialing establish legal and institutional permission to practice anesthesia. Licensure is granted by state regulatory boards (nursing or medical) and authorizes the provider to practice in that state. Credentialing is a hospital or clinic process that grants specific privileges within an institution. This domain clarifies how CRNAs, anesthesiologists, and AAs are licensed and credentialed, and what processes govern their authority to practice.

Key categories and components:

State licensure (CRNAs): CRNAs are licensed as APRNs (Advanced Practice Registered Nurses) in all states. They must hold an active RN license (by state board of nursing) and an APRN certificate specifically recognizing nurse anesthesia. Some states still require CRNAs to have a supervising agreement (collaboration) with a physician, while others allow full independent practice; licensing rules vary. Most states recognize NBCRNA certification for APRN licensure. Many states also participate in or plan to join the APRN Compact, which once active will allow multistate practice under one license
comphealth.com
. Currently, without the compact, CRNAs must obtain a separate license in each state they practice. A DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) number is needed for any provider, including CRNAs, who prescribe controlled substances, which is required of most.

State licensure (Physicians): Anesthesiologists hold state medical licenses issued by medical boards (via USMLE/COMLEX scores and med school/residency verification). They must also register with DEA and state pharmacy boards for prescribing controlled substances. Physician anesthesiologists typically have unrestricted practice rights once licensed; no special state anesthesia license beyond standard medical licensure is needed.

State licensure (AAs): AAs are licensed by state medical or anesthesiology boards in the states where they practice (those 22 states + DC + Guam
en.wikipedia.org
). No uniform compact exists. Licensing requires graduation from an accredited program and NCCAA certification. A DEA number can also be obtained in states permitting AAs to handle medications.

Institutional credentialing: Hospitals and clinics grant providers privileges through their medical staff processes. A provider must apply with verified credentials (primary source verification of education, license, certification, work history, malpractice claims, and NPDB query)
canainc.org
. A credentialing committee reviews qualifications (see Qualifications in [83] L69-77) and recommends privileges. Privileges specify what services the provider can perform (e.g. airway management, blocks, central line insertion). AANA guidelines suggest CRNA privileges should cover “core clinical practice” appropriate to their education
canainc.org
canainc.org
. For example, guidelines list airway management, regional blocks, sedation, and venous/arterial line insertion as typical CRNA privileges. Anesthesiologists are credentialed through the medical staff and typically given broad privileges in anesthesia, including supervising others.

Processes and verification: Credentialing requires primary source verification of degrees (e.g. via the National Practitioner Data Bank and the AANA repository), certifications, and licenses
canainc.org
. Hospitals must also check the National Practitioner Data Bank for any adverse actions on a provider’s record. Providers submit logs of clinical procedures to support privilege requests. Reappointment (every 1–3 years) involves reviewing performance (OPPE) and may include FPPE (focused evaluation) for new privileges. Telemedicine practice adds complexity: providers may need to be credentialed by both originating and distant sites (compacts and special policies are being developed).

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB): Both CRNAs and anesthesiologists are subject to NPDB reporting. Any revocation or limitation of privileges, malpractice payments, or other reportable actions must be reported. Credentialing committees review NPDB reports during initial and reappointment.

Governing bodies and standards: Licensure is governed by state laws (nurse practice acts, medical practice acts). Boards of Nursing and Medicine set scope regulations. Credentialing and privileging are guided by joint commission standards and CMS Conditions of Participation (which require peer review processes). Professional associations (AANA, ASA) issue guidelines for privileges but these are not legally binding. The AANA (via CANA) publishes suggested core privileges for CRNAs
canainc.org
.

Current state: All U.S. CRNAs are licensed as APRNs with anesthesia practice authority (though scope of independence varies by state). Seventeen states now grant CRNAs “full practice authority” (no required supervision) under nursing law. Many CRNAs also hold DEA registrations for prescribing. Anesthesiologists are universally licensed and credentialed with unrestricted privileges in anesthesia. CAAs are licensed in approved states and credentialed by the same medical staff process, typically with clear documentation that an anesthesiologist will supervise.

Credentialing committees in hospitals typically have an anesthesia representative or the department chair review anesthesia privileges. It’s common for a medical director (anesthesiologist) to set departmental privileging criteria. For CRNAs, committees review nursing license, NBCRNA certification, and clinical experience logs. Temporary privileges (locum tenens or post-graduate permits) may be granted on a short-term basis when needed, following hospital policy.

Emerging trends: The APRN compact (anticipated to require implementation by enough states) will change credentialing by allowing CRNAs to practice across state lines without multiple licenses
comphealth.com
. Telehealth growth (even in anesthesia e.g. remote intensive monitoring or pain consults) is prompting policies for multi-state credentialing. There is increasing scrutiny on peer review processes and quality metrics for recredentialing. Some institutions are moving toward “core privileges” that allow CRNAs and anesthesiologists to share cases seamlessly, with oversight defined by department policy rather than individual hospital bylaws.

Key terminology: State Licensure (APRN license, MD license), DEA Registration, Credentialing, Privilege Delineation, Primary Source Verification, NPDB (National Practitioner Data Bank), OPPE (Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation), FPPE (Focused Professional Practice Evaluation), Medical Staff Bylaws, Temporary Privileges (e.g. locum tenens), APRN Compact, Joint Commission, CMS (Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services) Conditions of Participation.

Domain 10: Interprofessional Practice Models and Team Configurations

Overview: This domain examines how anesthesia providers are organized into teams and practice models. Major models include independent CRNA practice, physician-led team practice, and mixed models. Understanding these configurations helps define the collaboration and supervision structure of anesthesia delivery.

Key categories and components:

Independent CRNA model: In this model, CRNAs provide anesthesia services without any required anesthesiologist involvement. CRNAs work alone, often in rural hospitals, ambulatory centers, or military settings. They perform all anesthesia tasks and are ultimately responsible for patient care during procedures. (In some cases, another physician on-site may handle medical issues but not anesthesia direction.) CMS refers to this as an “exclusive CRNA” model (modifier QZ billing). It is the most cost-effective model according to studies
amnhealthcare.com
. There is no federal law requiring physician supervision under this model; if state law demands supervision, a CRNA may partner with any available physician (not necessarily an anesthesiologist)
amnhealthcare.com
.

Anesthesia Care Team (ACT) / Medical Direction model: This common model is physician-led. An anesthesiologist leads a team of CRNAs and/or AAs. The physician provides medical direction for up to 4 concurrent nurse anesthetists
amnhealthcare.com
, following regulatory guidelines (the seven “medical direction” steps). In practice, the anesthesiologist evaluates patients pre-op, prescribes the anesthesia plan, and remains available in the operating suites or nearby during cases
amnhealthcare.com
amnhealthcare.com
. CRNAs deliver anesthesia under this plan, but the anesthesiologist shares accountability. ASA defines ACT as “care led by a physician anesthesiologist who directs or supervises qualified anesthesia personnel”
amnhealthcare.com
. Billing-wise, physician involvement is documented (modifier QK/AD for 2–4 cases). If one anesthesiologist directs two to four CRNAs, it’s full medical direction; if more than four or fewer steps, it’s considered “medical supervision.”

Team supervision model: Similar to ACT but with more flexibility. The physician supervises CRNAs on a looser basis (sometimes >4 cases), often in critical situations or emergencies. This is sometimes needed if a department has more CRNAs than anesthesiologists available; the supervising anesthesiologist may authorize care but not meet all direction criteria. (CMS term: modifier AD for supervising more than 4, rarely used).

All-physician model: Rare, but in some specialty settings only physician anesthesiologists and fellows are used (e.g. certain academic or pediatric centers). This model is costly and usually found in small (1-2 room) ASCs
amnhealthcare.com
.

Mixed MD+CRNA model: This variant blends ACT and supervision: an anesthesiologist works alongside CRNAs but may not be actively directing 4 each. It’s less structured than formal ACT but still involves physician oversight.

Obstetric and subspecialty team configurations: In obstetric units, sometimes MD/CRNA teams cover high-risk deliveries together, while routine cases may be independent. Cardiac and neuroanesthesia teams often are all-physician due to complexity. Pain clinics may use MD-only or MD+CRNA.

Geographic variations: Rural and small hospitals often rely on independent CRNA practice due to fewer MDs. Larger hospitals and surgery centers tend to use ACT or mixed models. AAs are always in ACT teams (never independent).

Governing bodies and standards: The ASA issues position statements on ACT (as noted above)
amnhealthcare.com
. CMS (a federal regulator) defines conditions of participation that influence practice models (e.g. requiring physician presence for induction/emergence, which technically mandates some supervision). Hospitals set policies in their medical staff bylaws on how anesthesia teams operate. The Joint Commission and other accrediting agencies require that supervision ratios be maintained for billing and quality.

Current state: The ACT model is widely used in U.S. hospitals, with anesthesiologists leading and directing CRNAs/AAs for many cases. The 1:4 ratio for direction is a routine ceiling
amnhealthcare.com
. In cost-focused settings (e.g. rural hospitals), independent CRNA practice is common; CRNAs there often work under the general direction of a surgeon or hospital policy rather than an anesthesiologist. Some systems (e.g. military, VA) allow all-CRNA practice under policy. All-CRNA models in AMA (Professional) terms occur where state laws permit it. Smaller ASCs may even staff entirely with CRNAs on overnight call or regional cases. In mixed models, any available physician (sometimes not even an anesthesiologist, like an emergency physician) can provide supervisory oversight if needed
amnhealthcare.com
.

Regarding staffing logistics: typically, an anesthesiologist on call will cover 3–4 CRNAs at most (due to the 4-case rule)
amnhealthcare.com
. If more coverage is needed (as in large hospitals), multiple anesthesiologists may each oversee groups of CRNAs. Handoff protocols are critical: providers must communicate patient status during shift changes, and both nurses and physicians participate in these handovers. Some systems use structured handoff tools (e.g. SBAR or Anesthesia-specific checklists) to maintain clarity.

Emerging trends: There is increasing recognition of the value of collaborative teams. Some institutions are formalizing “CRNA-only anesthesiology departments” for cost efficiency, while others emphasize the ACT model for quality. Research on outcomes is ongoing (some studies suggest no safety difference between models
amnhealthcare.com
). Tele-anesthesia (remote coverage by anesthesiologists for rural CRNAs via video/monitoring) is an emerging concept to extend expert oversight. Internationally, team models vary: e.g. the UK’s new “Anaesthesia Associates” role is similar to an AA working under consultants. In India and developing regions, nurse anesthetist-led teams are being explored to address shortages. Workforce discussions continue about optimal ratios and how models affect patient outcomes and costs
