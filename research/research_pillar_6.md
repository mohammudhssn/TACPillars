Pillar 6 research

Domain 1: Anesthesia Education Program Architecture

Overview: This domain covers the structure of anesthesia training programs (for both nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists), including curricula, governance, rotations, and accreditation. For example, U.S. CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist) programs are graduate-level (Master’s or DNP) curricula combining didactic coursework with extensive clinical practicum. A typical CRNA program spans 3–4 years post-baccalaureate (roughly 90 credits over 36 months) and includes ~2,500 clinical hours (≈800 cases) across specialties
school.wakehealth.edu
. Anesthesiology residencies (physician training) are 4-year programs (including an intern year), also integrating protected didactics and progressive responsibility. Both program types emphasize integration of classroom/simulation learning with hands-on clinical experience, building learners’ skills over time.

Key Components:

Program Type & Duration: CRNA programs (Master’s or DNP, ~3–4 years), physician residencies (4 years, plus optional fellowships).

Curriculum Structure: Integrated didactic (lectures, simulation, online modules) and clinical rotations. Many programs use “block” rotations through OR, ICU, OB, pain, ED, etc. Competency milestones define progression by year.

Rotations & Sites: Multiple hospitals or ambulatory surgery centers; academic centers often pair trainees with faculty, community sites supplement OR volume. Programs manage affiliate sites and preceptor assignments.

Governance & Administration: Each program has a director (MD or CRNA), curriculum committees, clinical coordinators, and oversight by the parent institution. Faculty must meet accreditation criteria (e.g. COA requires formal instructional training for core faculty
crnaeducationedge.aana.com
).

Evaluation & Outcomes: Programs monitor board-pass rates and clinical competence. Accreditation standards mandate continuous self-assessment (e.g. evaluating didactic quality, graduate competence, faculty scholarship
coacrna.org
) and use outcomes (NBCRNA exam scores, graduate employment) as quality metrics.

Standards & Organizations:

Accreditation Bodies: For CRNAs, the Council on Accreditation (COA) (under AANA) sets standards (e.g. entry-level Doctor of Nursing Practice by 2022). For physicians, the ACGME accredits residencies. Both require regular site visits and evaluation.

Certifying Boards: NBCRNA (National Board of Certification & Recertification for Nurse Anesthetists) administers CRNA certification exams; ABA (American Board of Anesthesiology) certifies physicians. State Boards of Nursing/Medicine/license boards ensure graduates meet practice requirements.

Professional Societies: AANA, ASA, ASA’s Committee on Quality, and equivalent bodies often publish curriculum guidelines and standards (e.g. ACGME program requirements). Internationally, WFSA and IFNA set or endorse educational standards in their regions.

Current State: U.S. CRNA programs now generally require doctoral degrees (DNP or DNAP) with a minimum of 600 distinct anesthesia cases in training
coacrna.org
. Didactic education is highly structured: ACGME requires a “broad range of structured didactics” (protected lectures, simulations, evidence-based discussions)
acgme.org
. Competency frameworks (ACGME Milestones for MDs; similar nursing competencies for CRNAs) guide resident progression. Programs increasingly use simulation centers (high- and low-fidelity models) to supplement clinical learning. Interprofessional training (shared simulation or OR experiences with surgical and nursing trainees) is growing. Program evaluation now relies on both process (curriculum content review) and outcome data (exam pass rates, graduate surveys
coacrna.org
).

Emerging Trends: There is a trend toward individualized competency-based progression (allowing advanced learners to accelerate, slower learners to remediate) and hybrid learning models. Internationally, more countries are developing non-physician anesthesia programs (with IFNA accreditation in places like China, India, parts of Africa
ifna.site
). Programs increasingly emphasize systems-based practice and evidence-based curriculum design, and may integrate tele-education (e.g. virtual grand rounds). Inter-institution collaborations (joint rotations) and global health tracks are expanding. Outcomes research from registries (e.g. NACOR, MPOG) may soon feed back into curriculum improvements.

Key Terminology: Curriculum, Didactic vs. Clinical Hours, Clinical Rotation, Competency Milestones (ACGME/CANA standards), Program Director, Affiliated Clinical Site, COA Standards (CRNAs), ACGME Program Requirements (MDs), Continuous Program Evaluation, Interprofessional Education, Global Anesthesia Education.

Domain 2: Teaching Methods & Instructional Design

Overview: This domain addresses how anesthesia educators design learning experiences. It emphasizes adult learning principles (learners self-directed, experiential) and competency-based frameworks. In practice, curricula are developed using instructional design models (e.g. Kern’s six steps) and adult pedagogy (Knowles’ andragogy). Educators mix teaching formats – lectures, case-based, team-based learning – to engage adult learners and manage cognitive load. Emphasis is on practical skill acquisition (often via simulation or bedside teaching) and on giving timely feedback. Remediation processes exist for learners who lag.

Key Components:

Learning Theories: Andragogy (adult learning), Kolb’s experiential learning, and Cognitive Load Theory (reducing extraneous load in teaching complex skills). For example, instruction is “problem-centered” and relevant to clinical goals
pedsanesthesia.org
.

Competency-Based Education (CBME): Curricula are often structured around competencies or EPAs (Entrustable Professional Activities) rather than time. Learners must meet milestones or EPAs (e.g. perform a safe general anesthetic, manage airway) with supervision graded to entrustment level. CBME uses frequent assessments to document growth.

Curriculum Development: Faculty use formal methodologies (e.g. Kern, ADDIE) to align objectives, content, teaching methods, and assessment. Spiral or integrated curricula introduce basic sciences alongside clinical cases.

Teaching Formats: Educators employ diverse formats: didactic lectures (often interactive), case-based discussions, team-based/problem-based learning, flipped classrooms (pre-learning material followed by interactive session), and blended learning (mixing online and in-person)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Example: an anesthesiology program reported that moving to a flipped/blended model significantly improved residents’ exam scores
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Clinical Teaching: On the wards/OR, methods include direct bedside teaching, supervised practice, and mentorship. Cognitive Load Theory guides teaching complex procedures by breaking them into manageable steps. Deliberate practice is used for psychomotor skills: learners repetitively practice a procedure (e.g. intubation) with focused objectives and expert feedback
litfl.com
.

Feedback & Coaching: Structured feedback models (e.g. Pendleton’s rules, ask-tell-ask) and regular coaching help learners reflect. Formative feedback is frequent and low-stakes, while summative evaluations occur at milestones or rotation ends.

EPAs & Milestones: Specialty-specific EPAs (core clinical tasks) are defined so trainees know what tasks they must be entrusted to perform unsupervised. These map to competency milestones. Educational programs are exploring EPA frameworks for anesthesia (e.g. managing anesthesia in obstetrics, airway, etc.).

Remediation: For struggling learners, programs create individualized learning plans, often involving extra simulation practice, tutoring, or adjusted rotations until competencies are met.

Standards & Organizations:

Accrediting & Regulatory: ACGME requires competency-based goals and structured feedback (milestones)
acgme.org
. COA (for CRNAs) mandates that curricula prepare graduates for full practice and incorporate evaluation of competencies
coacrna.org
coacrna.org
.

Education Bodies: Groups like the Society for Education in Anesthesia (SEA) and the American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) publish guides on effective teaching (e.g. emphasizing active learning, feedback). The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and others provide QI training resources. Internationally, WFSA provides resources on global education methods.

Current State: Most anesthesia programs now incorporate adult learning strategies: interactive lectures, simulation exercises, team-training drills, and e-learning modules. Flipped classrooms and online modules are increasingly used (as shown by improved test performance in blended curricula
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
). Competency committees use multiple workplace-based assessments (mini-CEX, DOPS, 360° feedback, procedure logs) to track progression. Some programs have formal teaching sessions for faculty (certificate in medical education). Across anesthesia education, there is growing use of EPA frameworks and rigorous instructional design to ensure learners meet defined competencies.

Emerging Trends: Digital education is growing: microlearning apps and spaced-repetition tools help reinforce knowledge. Virtual reality is being tested for procedural training (e.g. airway VR simulators). Adaptive learning platforms may personalize study. There is interest in learning analytics (tracking performance data to tailor training). Debriefing models (such as PEARLS or advocacy-inquiry) are being standardized to improve feedback quality. Research into remediation is refining how programs support learners (e.g., peer coaching, individualized modules). Andragogical methods evolve as newer theories (connectivism, social learning through FOAM communities) influence pedagogy.

Domain 3: Simulation & Experiential Learning

Overview: Simulation is a cornerstone of anesthesia education, providing safe hands-on practice. It spans high-fidelity manikins (full-scale OR simulators), part-task trainers (e.g. airway or vascular access models), screen-based virtual patients, and emerging VR/AR systems. Simulations range from routine scenarios to rare crisis drills. Experiential learning (active participation and reflection) underlies simulation training. Debriefing after simulation is critical for learner reflection and cognitive integration
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Key Components:

Types of Simulation:

High-Fidelity Mannequins: Full-body simulators mimic physiology, used for crisis drills (e.g. cardiac arrest, malignant hyperthermia) and routine OR scenarios.

Task Trainers: Low- to mid-fidelity models for specific skills (e.g. intubation heads, regional block arms, ultrasound trainers).

Virtual Patients & VR/AR: Computer-based scenarios or head-mounted displays for anesthesia concepts (e.g. VR airway practice, serious games). These are growing with consumer VR tech.

In-Situ Simulation: Running scenarios in actual clinical environments (OR, ICU) with on-duty staff, to reveal system issues and practice teamwork in context
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Simulation Centers & Programs: Many academic programs have dedicated simulation centers (with scrubbed OR spaces, control rooms, video recording) and scheduled curricula (e.g. Stanford’s multi-year “EVOLVE” simulation track
med.stanford.edu
). Centers support a full range: initial orientation (machine checks, basic inductions), crisis management (ACRM courses
med.stanford.edu
), and advanced team training. Some institutions offer simulation for community or off-service learners. Faculty often complete “train-the-trainer” courses (e.g. Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator).

Scenario Design: Scenarios are carefully scripted with learning objectives (e.g. management of tension pneumothorax). They may incorporate interprofessional roles (nurse, surgeon). Crisis Resource Management (CRM) principles (teamwork, communication, situational awareness) are key for team sims. Scenario design often includes built-in “injects” (unexpected events) to provoke decision-making.

Debriefing Methods: Structured debriefing is essential for learning. Methods include Plus-Delta (learners identify what went well vs what to improve)
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, PEARLS (Promoting Excellence And Reflective Learning in Simulation), and Advocacy-Inquiry (AIM). Debriefing is typically facilitator-led, encouraging reflection on performance and linking to learning points. Video-assisted debriefing is common.

Assessment in Simulation: Checklists and global rating scales are used to assess technical skills and team behaviors. Simulation can be used in high-stakes settings (e.g. some board OSCEs use simulated tasks). Research on simulation assessment emphasizes reliability (e.g. multiple raters, validated tools).

Standards & Organizations:

Accreditation/Guidelines: COA and ACGME expect programs to use simulation where appropriate (COA mandates simulation in clinical curriculum). Organizations like the Society for Simulation in Healthcare publish best practices. Debriefing frameworks (e.g. from the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare (DASH) tool) guide quality.

Professional Societies: AANA and ASA sponsor simulation courses (Anesthesia Simulation Education Network). Associations like SSH (Society for Simulation in Healthcare) and INACSL (debriefing standards) provide training for faculty.

Current State: Simulation is widely integrated: from orientation for new trainees to ongoing crisis training. Dedicated faculty run regular sim sessions (Stanford’s ACRM yearly drills
med.stanford.edu
). Many programs blend center-based sims with occasional in-situ drills (e.g. mock codes in an OR or ICU
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
). Debriefing after sims is routine, focusing on clinical decision-making and team communication. Certification-related CME increasingly uses simulation (e.g. ASA’s Advanced Simulation in Airway course). Some programs collaborate with other departments (anesthesia-nursing team sims).

Emerging Trends: Virtual reality and augmented reality simulators are advancing (e.g. VR for airway or regional block practice, AR overlays on mannequins). Simulation is extending beyond technical skills: in-situ systems simulations target systems issues (fire, equipment failure). “Serious games” and computer-based simulation modules are being used for independent study. Simulators are becoming more portable (laptop-based mannequins) for low-resource settings. Faculty development in debriefing is emphasized; new models like PEARLS script are used. Research is also looking at cost-effectiveness of different simulation modalities.

Key Terminology: High-fidelity Simulation, Task Trainer, In Situ Simulation, Crisis Resource Management (CRM), Scenario, Debriefing, Plus-Delta, Advocacy-Inquiry, PEARLS Debrief, Checklists vs Global Rating Scales, Simulation Center, Human Patient Simulator, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR).

Domain 4: Assessment & Competency Evaluation

Overview: This domain covers all methods used to measure learners’ knowledge, skills, and professional attributes. It ranges from written exams and clinical skills tests to workplace-based assessments and portfolio reviews. The goal is to ensure anesthesia trainees achieve defined competencies (cognitive, psychomotor, interpersonal). Assessments must be valid, reliable, and fair. Decisions (pass/fail, advancement) often rely on multiple sources of data, and formal committees synthesize them.

Key Components:

Knowledge Testing: Written exams (multiple-choice, essays) assess medical knowledge and decision-making. Boards (NBCRNA, ABA) use standardized tests (with psychometric anchoring). In-training exams (ITEs) benchmark residents annually.

Clinical Skills Exams: OSCEs (Objective Structured Clinical Exams) use standardized patients or scenarios to test history-taking, exam skills, crisis management. For anesthesiology, there are OR-based OSCE stations (e.g. crisis scenario) and oral boards (ABA’s oral exam).

Procedural Competency: Skills like intubation, IV placement, regional blocks are tracked via logs. Some programs use simulation or observed procedural checklists to verify proficiency.

Workplace-Based Assessment (WBA): Faculty observe trainees in real clinical settings. Tools include Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), Mini-CEX (focused clinical evaluation), CEX (longer encounter eval), and case logs. Residents also self-assess performance regularly.

Multi-Source (360°) Feedback: Evaluations from peers, nurses, patients, and attending anesthesiologists gauge professionalism, communication and teamwork. ACGME recommends 360° feedback for interpersonal and communication competencies
seahq.org
. Studies show it can improve communication scores
seahq.org
.

Portfolios: Some programs use e-portfolios where trainees compile case logs, procedure videos, feedback, and reflections. Committees review portfolios for holistic assessment.

Psychometrics: High-stakes exams (certification/recert) undergo rigorous test construction. Reliability (consistency) and validity (measuring intended competency) are evaluated. Exams are blueprint-aligned to professional practice analyses. Statistical methods (item response theory, Cronbach’s alpha) ensure quality.

Standard-Setting Methods: Pass/fail cutoffs are set via methods like Modified Angoff (experts estimate probability of a borderline candidate answering each item correctly) or Hofstee compromise method
nbcrna.com
. For example, NBCRNA used Angoff and Hofstee with SME panels to set passing scores
nbcrna.com
.

Competency Committees: Regular meetings (e.g. semi-annual) review aggregated assessment data for each trainee. Committees decide promotions or identify remediations. They integrate quantitative scores with narrative faculty reports.

Bias Mitigation: Training evaluators to use objective criteria and structured forms helps reduce bias. Tools like standardized rubrics and blinded review can address rater variability.

Standards & Organizations:

ACGME: Sets requirements for resident evaluation systems (evaluations every rotation, semi-annual Milestones review). Also endorses multi-source feedback and core competencies.

NBCRNA/ABA: Psychometric standards (AERA/APA guidelines) guide certifying exams. They publish test content outlines and certify item writers.

Professional Societies: ASA and AANA have education committees that develop best practices for assessment. SEA (Society for Education in Anesthesia) provides workshops on evaluation strategies.

Accrediting Agencies: COA and ACGME require evidence of valid assessment (e.g. use of competency committees, documented remediation processes).

Current State: Assessment in anesthesia is highly structured. Graduations from residency/CRNA programs are contingent on passing all forms of evaluation: written in-training and board exams, technical skills sign-offs, and milestone attainment. OSCEs are used in some high-stakes settings (ABA’s OSCE stations in the OSCE portion of ABA exams). Workplace-based assessments are routine each month. 360° surveys are commonly used mid- or end-year. Program directors use all these data to make summative decisions, often with guidance from Milestone descriptors (for MDs) or CRNA competencies. Remediation plans are triggered by failing key assessments.

Emerging Trends: Electronic evaluation systems and dashboards now integrate data streams (e.g. MedHub, New Innovations). Learning analytics may soon alert faculty to learners who fall behind. More granular EPAs are being adopted to make entrustment decisions explicit. Simulation-based assessments are expanding (e.g. standardized crisis sim for a final-year exam). There is growing awareness of implicit bias in evaluation; programs are adopting rater training (e.g. on unconscious bias) and using multiple examiners to improve fairness. Assessment for lifelong learning (self-assessment modules) is also developing.

Key Terminology: OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination), Milestones, Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA), 360° Feedback, Mini-CEX, Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), Modified Angoff, Hofstee Method, Reliability, Validity, Blueprint, Summative vs. Formative, Competency Committee, Benchmarking, Rater Bias.

Domain 5: Continuing Education & Lifelong Learning

Overview: This domain covers post-training education and maintenance of competence for practicing anesthesia professionals. It includes formal Continuing Medical Education (CME) requirements set by boards and licensure, as well as informal learning activities. Providers engage in a mix of structured courses, self-study, on-the-job learning, and quality projects to update their skills and meet regulatory requirements.

Key Components:

Mandated CME/CE: Physicians must earn CME credits (e.g. 50 AMA Category 1 credits every 2 years for ABA MOCA), and CRNAs must earn 60 Class A (CME) credits per 4-year cycle
nbcrna.com
. These are often obtained via accredited courses, online modules, conferences, or approved journal activities.

Certifying Bodies’ Programs: NBCRNA’s CPC (Continuing Professional Certification) historically required 60 Class A and 40 Class B credits plus four core modules and a cognitive exam
nbcrna.com
. ABA’s Maintenance of Certification (MOCA) program requires ongoing CME and Quality Improvement (QI) modules. Both now emphasize active learning and QI.

Self-Assessment and Improvement: Programs offer self-assessment modules (SAMs) that include questions and linked learning. For anesthesiologists, ABA’s Perioperative High-Risk Assessment (PHRA) is an example. Many providers review performance (case outcomes) and identify gaps for learning.

Just-in-Time & Point-of-Care Learning: Clinicians use digital resources (UpToDate, apps, podcasts) for immediate learning needs. “Just-in-time” education can be triggered by case requirements.

Online Learning Platforms: Webinars, recorded lectures, and e-learning (modules, virtual grand rounds) allow asynchronous learning. Spaced repetition tools (flashcards, quiz apps) aid long-term retention.

Microlearning: Brief learning units (podcasts, short videos) are popular for busy providers.

Conferences and Workshops: National meetings (e.g. ASA Annual Meeting, AANA Congress, subspecialty society conferences) offer plenaries, hands-on workshops, and small-group courses. Often these provide CME credits.

Simulation-based CE: Simulation workshops (e.g. crisis management courses) may count for CME and skill refreshment.

QI as CE: Engaging in quality improvement projects can fulfill learning requirements (ABA MOCA Part 4 or NBCRNA Part IV). For example, analyzing departmental outcomes or participating in registries (MPOG, ASPIRE) is a form of learning.

Learning Management Systems (LMS): Institutions and societies use LMS platforms to track CE, host courses, and administer assessments. Hospitals may have internal LMS for physician continuing education tracking.

Measuring CE Impact: Providers and regulators increasingly seek evidence that CE changes practice (Kirkpatrick Levels 3/4). Surveys, follow-up tests, and practice audits attempt to gauge learning effect.

Standards & Organizations:

State/National Requirements: Boards of Medicine/Nursing set minimum CME hours and often specify types of credit (patient safety, opioid prescribing, etc.).

Certifying Boards: NBCRNA, ABA, and American Board of Medicine Specialists (ABMS) each have ongoing certification requirements (CPC, MOCA). These dictate credit totals and content (e.g. mandatory patient safety modules).

Accrediting Bodies: ACCME accredits CME providers to ensure quality (commercial bias disclosure, evidence-based content). AMA and AANP oversee Continuing Education accreditation.

Professional Societies: ASA, AANA, Canadian, European societies run or endorse CME courses, webinars, and journals (with CME quizzes). Specialty-specific organizations (e.g. obstetric anesthesia societies) offer targeted CE.

Current State: Anesthesia providers routinely mix formal CME with self-directed learning. The NBCRNA CPC program (legacy) required 60 Class A (CME) and 40 Class B (other scholarly activities)
nbcrna.com
. Many use AMA PRA Category 1 Accredited courses (lectures, simulation). Online modules (CMEOnDemand, MDLinx, etc.) are widely used. CME tracking software helps clinicians and institutions manage credit logging. Despite abundant options, common barriers exist: busy schedules, cost of courses, and difficulty accessing high-quality content. Mandates (like the NBCRNA two-year “check-in” and modules) help keep practitioners engaged
nbcrna.com
.

Emerging Trends: There is growth in micro-credentialing and “digital badges” for focused skills (e.g. airway management certificate). Adaptive learning platforms may tailor CE to practice gaps identified via outcome data. Podcast-based CME and FOAMed resources (blogs, YouTube channels) are gaining acceptance for informal learning (though formal credit via these is limited). More CE is being delivered virtually (accelerated by COVID-19), including virtual conferences and simulation. CME is increasingly linked to measurable outcomes (participation in QI as CME). Lifelong learning philosophies (self-directed learning plans, portfolio-based CPD) are being emphasized by boards.

Key Terminology: CME/CE Credits, Category 1 CME, Maintenance of Certification (MOCA), Continued Professional Certification (CPC), Self-Assessment Module (SAM), Perioperative Improvement Project (PIP)/Performance Improvement Module (PIM), Just-in-Time Learning, Microlearning, Learning Management System (LMS), Kirkpatrick Levels, Lifelong Learning, Maintenance of Licensure (MOL).

Domain 6: Research Methodology & Evidence Generation

Overview: This domain encompasses the methods anesthesia professionals use to generate new knowledge. It includes designing and conducting clinical trials, observational studies, quality improvement research, and other study types; synthesizing data; and following research ethics. Good research methodology ensures that findings are valid and can inform practice. Anesthesia research spans drug/device trials, outcome studies, and implementation science.

Key Components:

Clinical Trials: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for testing interventions (new drugs, techniques, devices). Anesthesiology runs RCTs on topics like analgesic efficacy, hemodynamic control, etc. Pragmatic trials (in routine practice settings) and adaptive designs are also used. FDA processes (phase I–III studies) guide drug development; anesthesia devices follow FDA pathways (510(k) or PMA)
mdpi.com
.

Observational Studies: Cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), case-control, and cross-sectional studies examine exposures (e.g. certain airway devices) and outcomes. Retrospective research often uses existing databases (e.g. billing/AIMS data) to study complications or practice patterns. Big data analytics (machine learning on large datasets) are emerging.

Quality Improvement (QI) Research: QI differs from conventional research by focus on local improvements and iterative PDSA cycles. Methods include Run charts, statistical process control to see if changes produce real improvement. Unlike RCTs, QI projects often forego IRB if considered operational improvement, but formal QI research must still meet ethical oversight when intended for generalizable knowledge.

Surveys and Qualitative Research: Surveys (questionnaires) assess clinician or patient opinions; they can be descriptive or comparative. Qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups) explore behaviors, attitudes, e.g. on team dynamics or burnout. Proper survey design and qualitative coding are important skills.

Systematic Reviews & Meta-Analyses: These synthesize existing evidence. A systematic review follows a structured search strategy (PRISMA guidelines) to identify all relevant studies on a question. Meta-analysis pools quantitative results (often RCTs) using statistical methods. Network meta-analysis compares multiple interventions simultaneously. These are common in anesthesiology (e.g. comparing regional vs general techniques).

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs): Increasingly anesthesia research includes PRO measures (e.g. Quality of Recovery scores, pain scores, functional outcomes) as study endpoints. Instrument development and validation are part of PRO research.

Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER): CER studies compare outcomes of different treatments in real-world settings. For example, comparing regional blocks vs IV analgesia using registry data.

Implementation Science: Focuses on how to translate research into practice. In anesthesia, this might study how to implement guidelines (e.g. checklists) in departments, measuring uptake and barriers.

Ethics & IRB: All human subject research requires IRB review (exceptions for some QI). Informed consent is needed for patient interventions. Anesthesiology research often deals with vulnerable populations (pediatric, critically ill), requiring extra oversight.

Funding: Common sources include NIH (R01, K-series), foundation grants (IARS, ASA Found., AANA Research Fund), industry sponsorship (drug/device trials), and institutional funds. Grant-writing is a key skill for academic anesthesiologists/CRNAs.

Statistics: From basic (descriptive, t-tests, chi-square) to advanced (multivariate regression, survival analysis, Bayesian methods). Anesthesiology research often uses biostatistics to adjust for confounders. Learning statistics is integral for researchers.

Registries & Databases: The specialty has national data repositories: NACOR (ASA’s National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry), MPOG (Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group), and anesthesiology contributions to ACS-NSQIP. These allow multi-center observational studies and QI benchmarking. For example, MPOG collects granular data on all cases (from 4 h before to 6 h after anesthesia) from both academic and community hospitals
mpog.org
, enabling large-scale outcomes research.

Standards & Organizations:

Research Ethics Boards: Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) govern human research. Boards like the NIH and FDA set regulations (e.g. for drug/device trials).

Funding Agencies: NIH (NINDS, NHLBI etc.), AHRQ, foundation grants (IARS, ASA). Industry sponsors often fund trials of new anesthetic agents or monitors.

Statistical Guidelines: CONSORT guidelines for RCT reporting, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews ensure methodological rigor. Cochrane Collaboration sets high standards for meta-analysis.

Professional Societies: ASA, AANA, international organizations have research sections that share methods advances. Journals (Anesthesiology, A&A) often host methodology tutorials. CRNA educators may use ANAAR or IARS resources.

Current State: Anesthesia research utilizes all these methods. Many departments have research tracks (residency research time, CRNA DNP projects). Observational research using big data registries (MPOG, NACOR) is expanding; MPOG’s quality arm (ASPIRE) focuses on generating data-driven improvement measures
mpog.org
. Systematic reviews in anesthesia are common and often feed guideline development. Implementation science is emerging (studies on guideline uptake). Clinician-scientist collaborations (with epidemiologists/statisticians) are typical for robust studies. In recent years, research on topics like perioperative telemedicine, ERAS protocols, and AI predictions has grown.

Emerging Trends: Machine learning and AI are entering research (predictive analytics for hypotension, sedation needs). Precision anesthesia (using genomics, biomarkers for tailoring care) is nascent. Big-data platforms (e.g. common data models) may enable federated research across institutions. There is interest in registry-based randomized trials (embedding RCTs into clinical workflows). “Living meta-analyses” that update continuously with new studies are being piloted. Tele-research (remote data collection, virtual trials) is increasing post-COVID.

Key Terminology: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), Cohort Study, Case-Control Study, Cross-Sectional Study, Quality Improvement (QI) Study, Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, Network Meta-Analysis, Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO), Implementation Science, IRB (Institutional Review Board), Grant Mechanism (R01, K08), Biostatistics, Registry Research (e.g. NACOR, MPOG), Data Analytics, Research Ethics.

Domain 7: Evidence Evaluation & Guidelines Development

Overview: Once research is generated, this domain covers how evidence is appraised and turned into recommendations. It includes systematic review methodology, consensus processes, and guideline creation. In anesthesia, evidence evaluation ensures practices are based on best-available science. Professional societies and panels synthesize data into guidelines or position statements for clinical care (e.g. airway management, analgesia). Key steps are grading evidence quality, developing consensus, and facilitating knowledge translation into practice.

Key Components:

Evidence Grading: Systems like GRADE classify quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low) and strength of recommendations. GRADE explicitly weighs benefits/harms. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine also provides levels of evidence (1-5). Guideline panels use these systems to communicate confidence.

Guideline Development: Professional societies (e.g. ASA, ASA Closed Claims committee, ASA-ERAS, AANA) form writing groups. Process involves: defining clinical questions (often PICO format), conducting systematic literature reviews, and drafting recommendations. Panels typically include experts, methodologists, and sometimes patient reps.

Systematic Reviews for Guidelines: Before recommendations, evidence is summarized via systematic reviews (sometimes by Cochrane). Transparent search strategies and evidence tables underpin guidelines.

Consensus Methods: When evidence is lacking, structured consensus is used. Methods include the Delphi technique (anonymous iterative surveys of experts) and the Nominal Group Technique (structured in-person discussion). These converge on best practice statements.

Consensus Conferences/Workshops: International gatherings (e.g. ESA EurSafety airway consensus) develop guidelines via multi-stage consensus processes.

Knowledge Translation (KT): After guidelines are published, KT frameworks (Knowledge-to-Action cycle, PARiHS [Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services]) guide implementation. Steps include adapting guidelines locally, educating clinicians, and monitoring uptake.

Barriers and De-Implementation: Implementation science identifies barriers (e.g. resistance to change, resource limits). There is also a focus on de-implementation of low-value or harmful practices (e.g. avoiding routine pre-op testing when not indicated). Rapid review methods and “living guidelines” (continuously updated recommendations) are emerging to keep guidance current.

Conflict of Interest (COI): Guidelines strive to manage COIs. Panels usually require disclosure, and journals check for undue influence. Formal policies (IOM Standards) exist.

Guideline Assessment: Tools like AGREE II evaluate guideline quality (scope, stakeholder involvement, rigor, clarity, applicability, editorial independence). Professionals may appraise guidelines before adoption.

Standards & Organizations:

Professional Societies: ASA, AANA, APSF (Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation), WFSA, ESRA, and subspecialty societies produce guidelines. Each has a methodology committee.

Evidence Bodies: Organizations like GRADE Working Group provide methodology for grading evidence and recommendations. The Institute of Medicine (IOM, now NAS) has published standards for trustworthy guidelines.

Consensus Groups: International bodies (e.g. SAFE for global anesthesia education) host consensus panels. National bodies (CDC, WHO) sometimes involve anesthesia experts for perioperative guidelines.

Current State: Many anesthesia guidelines now explicitly use GRADE or similar frameworks to rate evidence and recommendations. Systematic reviews underpin guidelines (often published alongside). For example, the ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm is periodically updated through expert consensus and literature review. Knowledge translation efforts include simulation-based training of guideline protocols (e.g. crisis checklist drills). Peer-reviewed journals increasingly require guideline disclosures and methodology transparency.

Emerging Trends: Living guidelines (constantly updated as new evidence emerges) are developing (exemplified during COVID-19). Big data and network meta-analyses enable comparison of multiple treatments. Digital decision support (embedding guidelines into EHRs) is growing. “De-implementation” science is maturing: actively identifying and removing ineffective practices (e.g. >85% O₂ not useful) to reduce waste. Stakeholders use social media and apps to disseminate guidelines more broadly.

Key Terminology: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, GRADE, Quality of Evidence, Consensus Conference, Delphi Method, Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Cycle, PARIHS Framework, Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG), Living Guideline, Conflict of Interest, AGREE II, Evidence Synthesis, De-Implementation, Rapid Review.

Domain 8: Quality Improvement (QI) Science

Overview: QI science focuses on systematically improving processes and outcomes in anesthesia practice. It differs from traditional research by emphasizing iterative change, system analysis, and team-based interventions. QI projects aim to enhance patient safety and efficiency (e.g. reducing perioperative hypothermia, improving turnover time) by applying industrial principles. This domain covers methodologies (PDSA cycles, Lean, Six Sigma), analytic tools (run charts), human factors engineering, and safety culture concepts.

Key Components:

QI Methodologies:

Model for Improvement/PDSA: Define Aim, select Measures, then Plan–Do–Study–Act cycles to test changes on small scale.

Lean: Focus on eliminating waste (unnecessary steps) to streamline flow.

Six Sigma: Reduce variability and defects using data-driven methods (DMAIC cycle: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).

Many anesthesia QI projects use these or combinations.

Analysis Tools: Run charts and control charts (statistical process control) track metrics over time to distinguish real change from random variation. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigates serious events to identify system failures. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is done proactively to predict and mitigate process failures (e.g. emergency drug availability).

Human Factors & Safety Culture: Anesthesia QI heavily draws on safety science. Concepts like Crew Resource Management (team communication) and Just Culture (balancing accountability) are implemented. Human factors engineering principles (designing equipment/layout to prevent error) are applied. High Reliability Organization (HRO) ideas (preoccupation with failure, resilience) inform QI strategies.

Measurement: Distinguish improvement measures (tracking performance) from research measures (rigorous data for publication). QI emphasizes rapid-cycle measurement (frequent, low-cost data). Balancing measures are identified to catch unintended consequences (e.g. faster turnover might increase staff workload).

Implementation: Successful QI involves frontline staff engagement, often via multidisciplinary teams. Changes (checklists, protocols) are trialed on one unit, then scaled. Sustaining improvement may require embedding in policy and ongoing monitoring. Spread means sharing successful interventions to other settings.

QI Programs/Collaboratives: National initiatives (IHI’s perioperative projects, CERTAIN toolkit) exist. Anesthesia-specific: ASA/AQI’s projects (e.g. opioid stewardship), ASPIRE/MPOG collaborative engages hundreds of hospitals in benchmarking measures
mpog.org
. The ASA’s Closed Claims project informs QI targets. State or group collaboratives (e.g. Michigan’s ASPIRE, Blue Cross Blue Shield initiatives) promote shared learning.

QMS & Accreditation: Many institutions use formal Quality Management Systems; anesthesia departments may follow hospital QI processes. JCAHO (Joint Commission) standards often include perioperative safety indicators. Data registries (NACOR) provide reports on quality measures back to practices.

Standards & Organizations:

IHI (Institute for Healthcare Improvement): Popularized the Model for Improvement and PDSA. IHI provides training modules and collaboratives (e.g. perioperative graphic of safety).

Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ): Publishes patient safety tools and guidelines.

Lean Six Sigma Certification Bodies: Some healthcare professionals pursue Six Sigma (Green/Black Belt) training.

ASA/AQI: The Anesthesia Quality Institute (AQI) was created by ASA to house anesthesia QI data (AIRS for incidents, NACOR for routine care)
openanesthesia.org
. AQI provides feedback reports to participants.

MPOG/ASPIRE: MPOG’s ASPIRE is a QI network that has developed >30 anesthesia measures (e.g. preventing inadvertent hypothermia) and provides dashboards for participants
mpog.org
.

Current State: Anesthesia departments routinely undertake QI projects (e.g. reducing opioid use, standardizing pre-op checklists). PDSA cycles are widely taught in residency. Many hospitals have anesthesia QI committees. Departments track metrics like on-time starts, hypothermia rates. QI collaboratives and registries offer benchmarking so practices see their performance vs peers (NACOR participation enables this). Simulation and drills often serve as QI interventions (e.g. mock code to improve response time). Regulatory QI requirements (e.g. CMS EHR Meaningful Use, core measures) also drive data collection.

Emerging Trends: There is an increasing use of digital dashboards and real-time analytics to monitor QI projects. Predictive analytics (AI-based alerting for events like hypotension) overlap QI and innovation. Human factors and ergonomics get more formal application (designing anesthesia workstations or communication protocols). Patient-centered outcomes (satisfaction, functional recovery) are being integrated into QI. The idea of “Learning Health Systems” – where data from every case is used to continuously improve – is advancing (MPOG’s THRIVE initiative and others). Inter-hospital networks for QI (like states using AQI’s quality data) are growing to scale improvement efforts.

Domain 9: Innovation & Emerging Science

Overview: This domain covers the pipeline of new technologies and scientific frontiers in anesthesia. It includes invention, development, testing, and implementation of new drugs, devices, and digital tools. Anesthesia practitioners contribute to and adopt innovations from biomedical engineering, informatics, and basic science. Innovation processes (from idea to FDA clearance/commercialization) and emerging fields (AI, genomics, consciousness research) are key topics.

Key Components:

Medical Device & Drug Development: New anesthesia-related devices (monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps) or therapeutics go through R&D. This involves concept development, prototyping, bench testing, animal studies, and phased clinical trials. Regulatory pathways (FDA’s 510(k) for devices deemed equivalent, PMA for novel devices; IND/NDA for drugs) must be followed. “Closed-loop anesthesia” devices (automated IV titration) have been prototyped (e.g. the “McSleepy” system). Development of novel anesthetics (agents with faster recovery or fewer side effects) follows standard pharmacological pipelines.

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: AI is a major emerging area. Machine learning algorithms are being applied to perioperative data for predictions (e.g. forecasting hypotension, difficult airway). AI integration includes predictive analytics (early warning systems) and decision support tools embedded in anesthesia machines or EHRs. AI is also used in education (e.g. adaptive learning). Regulatory agencies (FDA) have created pathways for AI-enabled devices (with considerations for continuous learning algorithms)

Digital Health & Telemedicine: Mobile apps for monitoring (e.g. pain tracking, sedation depth apps), wearable sensors (continuous pulse oximeters, fitness trackers), and tele-anesthesia (remote support for remote locations) are growing. These innovations can extend anesthesiologist reach (e.g. supervising multiple ORs or providing tele-ICU sedation guidance).

Closed-Loop Systems & Automation: Work on automated anesthesia delivery (closed-loop control of anesthetic dose based on EEG/BIS, blood pressure) is advancing. For example, predictive control algorithms have shown the ability to reduce intraoperative hypotension by up to 40%
mdpi.com
. Automation in anesthesia includes pharmacy robots, automated documentation, and even robot-assisted intubation research.

Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Development of rapid tests (e.g. coagulation point-of-care assays, portable blood gas analyzers) that can be used in the OR/ICU is an innovation area. Handheld ultrasound advances (miniaturization) also fall here.

Innovation Ecosystems: Academic–industry partnerships (e.g. hospital innovation labs, biotech incubators) foster new anesthesia technologies. Grants and translational programs (e.g. NIH’s SBIR/STTR) support anesthesia startups. Professional networks (IARS Innovation Symposium, XPrize) encourage clinician inventors.

Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialization: Clinicians often file patents on novel ideas (new monitoring algorithms, devices). Tech transfer offices manage patenting and licensing. Understanding IP (patents, licensing deals) is increasingly important for academic anesthesiologists.

Emerging Science Frontiers: Novel research areas include anesthesia effects on consciousness (using neuroscience to understand anesthesia mechanism), chronobiology (timing of anesthesia relative to circadian rhythms), and genomics/precision medicine (pharmacogenomics for drug dosing, genetic predictors of anesthesia sensitivity). Big Data and genomics are being applied to predict perioperative risk.

Regulatory & Adoption Frameworks: New technologies require assessment frameworks (e.g. health technology assessment bodies, FDA guidelines for mHealth). Adoption science studies how novel devices/tech are integrated into practice. Ethical/regulatory issues (data privacy under HIPAA/GDPR for digital tools) are part of innovation.

Standards & Organizations:

FDA/EMA Regulations: FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Center for Drug Evaluation set standards for anesthesia tech/devices. The FDA’s Digital Health Innovation Action Plan outlines pathways for AI and apps
mdpi.com
.

Professional Bodies: ASA/AANA committees often evaluate emerging tech (e.g. guideline statements on monitors). IARS (International Anesthesia Research Society) holds innovation forums. SAGES (Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons) and others intersect with anesthesia innovation (e.g. ERAS protocols).

Standards Groups: IEEE and ISO develop standards (e.g. for waveform monitoring data exchange). HIMSS and health IT groups address EHR/technology issues.

Current State: Many anesthesia departments maintain continuous improvement/innovation initiatives. Closed-loop anesthesia systems have been demonstrated in trials (though not yet widespread commercially). AI pilot projects (predicting hypotension, automating record-keeping) are underway in academic centers. Mobile health: Apps for anesthesia care (e.g. opioid calculators, decision aids) exist but are not yet ubiquitous. Use of consumer wearables in perioperative care is being trialed. Innovation challenge competitions and hackathons (e.g. NASA’s challenges on patient monitoring) involve anesthesiologists.

Emerging Trends: AI/ML will likely become part of decision-support: e.g. algorithms alerting to at-risk events or suggesting dosages. Robotics may enter anesthesiology (robotic intubators, tele-anesthesia robots). Wearable sensors (continuous capnography, wireless EEG) may be validated for monitoring. Pharmacogenomic panels could guide anesthetic selection. Virtual reality tools for patient experience (anxiety reduction, education) are being tested. Health technology assessment will increasingly evaluate value of new tech (cost-effectiveness analyses). Interoperability standards (FHIR APIs) will facilitate innovation by allowing new apps to plug into health data.

Domain 10: Knowledge Dissemination & Scientific Communication

Overview: This domain addresses how anesthesia knowledge is shared and communicated. It covers the scholarly publication process, conferences, and emerging digital dissemination (social media, preprints). Anesthesia professionals must be adept at writing and presenting research, understanding open access models, and engaging diverse audiences (peers, trainees, and the public). It also includes data transparency and reproducibility practices.

Key Components:

Peer Review & Publication: Traditional journals (Anesthesiology, A&A, Canadian J Anesthesia, etc.) and subspecialty journals (Pain, Pediatrics, Cardiothoracics) vet research through peer review. Understanding manuscript preparation, reviewer expectations, and revision is key. Open access journals (e.g. Journal of Anesthesia, A&A’s open-access sister journals) allow wider distribution. The review process can be single- or double-blinded.

Authorship & Ethics: Standards (ICMJE) govern who qualifies as an author and require disclosure of conflicts of interest. Publication ethics (no plagiarism, accurate reporting) is enforced by COPE guidelines. Reproducibility concerns (access to raw data, transparency of methods) are increasingly emphasized; some journals require data-sharing statements.

Preprints and Rapid Dissemination: Preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv) allow researchers to share manuscripts before peer review. During COVID-19, anesthesia researchers used preprints for rapid sharing. Preprints speed dissemination but pose challenges (non-peer-reviewed content).

Conferences & Meetings: Major anesthesia conferences (ASA, AANA, regional/anesthesia subspecialties) are primary venues for sharing new research (abstracts, posters, podium talks). Abstract submission, peer-review of abstracts, and poster/oral presentation skills are part of scientific communication. International meetings (WFSA World Congress) also disseminate knowledge globally.

Digital Scholarship & Social Media: Online channels (Twitter [X], blogs, podcasts, YouTube) play a growing role. “FOAMed” (Free Open Access Meducation) platforms (e.g. LITFL, EMCrit, OpenAnesthesia summaries) provide informal education. Social media hashtags (#FOAMed, #AnesPapers) help clinicians find resources. Journals now often tweet links to articles (increasing altmetrics). Academics may maintain blogs or podcast series on anesthesia topics.

Science Communication: Anesthesiologists increasingly engage lay audiences (through media interviews, public lectures) to explain anesthesia research or dispel myths (e.g. anesthesia safety). Skills in translating jargon to plain language are valued.

Society Roles: Professional societies (ASA, AANA, Canadian, European societies) publish news bulletins, guidelines, and host webinars for members. They maintain reference websites (practice parameters) and run CME educational series.

Open Science Practices: The movement toward open science encourages data sharing (data repositories, open access code), use of reporting checklists (CONSORT, PRISMA). Journals may offer or require open peer review. Pre-registration of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) is standard.

Metrics: Traditional metrics include journal Impact Factor and individual citation count. New metrics (altmetrics) track online attention (social media mentions, news articles). h-index is used to assess researcher productivity. Author and journal profiles (ORCID, Publons) track contributions.

Standards & Organizations:

Journal Governance: COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) sets standards for ethical publishing. ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) provides authorship guidelines. DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) lists vetted open-access journals.

Societies & Foundations: ASA, AANA publish journals and sets policies (e.g. AANA Journal). OpenAnesthesia.org (an educational site) provides FOAMed resources. WFSA and regional societies coordinate global knowledge exchange.

Current State: The landscape is hybrid: traditional journals coexist with digital media. Most anesthesia researchers aim to publish in high-impact journals; open access is becoming more common (either via OA journals or paying fees to make articles OA). Social media has a foothold: many anesthesiologists read and share new studies on Twitter, and FOAMed blogs are widely used by trainees. Many conferences have live-tweeting of sessions. Data sharing requirements (e.g. NIH data management policy) are influencing practices. Research reproducibility initiatives (like sharing statistical code) are gradually adopted.

Emerging Trends: Preprint use is rising; some anesthesiology groups encourage preprinting to accelerate dissemination. Journals are experimenting with novel formats (graphical abstracts, video abstracts). Social media “journal clubs” and online CME (webinars, on-demand sessions) are growing. Blogs and podcasts have become valuable for quick updates (e.g. weekly anesthesia podcasts summarizing new papers). Lay communication is emphasized: clinicians use platforms like TEDx or hospital outreach to educate the public. Altmetrics (article-level metrics, tweets) are being considered in academic promotion. Data repositories and open-source tools for analysis (e.g. R packages) are expanding.
