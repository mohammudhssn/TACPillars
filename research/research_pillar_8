Pillar 8: Culture, Wellbeing, History, and Societal Dimensions of the Anesthesia Profession
Domain 1: Provider Mental Health & Psychological Wellbeing

Overview: Anesthesia providers face intense emotional demands and psychological hazards. They risk depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders due to high-stakes work and easy access to potent drugs
aana.com
openanesthesia.org
. “Second‐victim” syndrome – distress after a patient’s adverse outcome – is common, with 17% of anesthesiologists reporting severe second‐victim trauma
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Suicide risk is elevated among nurses, and anesthesia trainees show warning signs of suicidal ideation, highlighting the need for prevention
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Key subsystems: Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), substance use/addiction, burnout overlap (emotional exhaustion), suicide prevention, second-victim responses, critical‐incident stress, stigma and help-seeking barriers, peer support and wellness programs, licensing/regulatory issues related to disclosure, re-entry programs post-treatment, and crisis intervention (psychological first aid).

Current state: Recent surveys find rising burnout among CRNAs (from ~6% pre-pandemic to ~16%) and severe burnout in nearly 40% during COVID
aana.com
. Anxiety/depression are also present: one study reported ~24% of anesthesiology nurses and 6% of physicians with high anxiety, and elevated depression in 15.5% of nurses (6.1% of physicians)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Substance use is a known risk: about 2.87 cases of SUD per 1,000 anesthesia residents per year have been reported
openanesthesia.org
, and roughly 12–16% of all healthcare workers misuse drugs/alcohol at some point
openanesthesia.org
. A survey of nurse-anesthesia students found ~0.65% had recognized substance issues (primarily opioids) over five years
researchgate.net
. Mental health stigma persists: many providers hesitate to seek help due to fear of judgment or licensure questions. In fact, 40% of physicians in one survey said fear of losing a license would deter them from treatment
ama-assn.org
. Licensing boards are revising intrusive questions, and peer support lines (e.g. AANA Helpline) and hotlines (Don’t Clock Out, PeerRxMed) have expanded. Program directors report student suicides and call for wellness training
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, and new support programs (like the UCLA peer-support team) show positive effects on second-victim outcomes
sciencedirect.com
sciencedirect.com
.

Key challenges: Stigma and career fear hinder help-seeking. Heavy workloads and perfectionism fuel mental strain. Cultural norms in medicine often discourage showing vulnerability. Licensure questions (now largely removed) historically created fear of disclosure. Many struggling clinicians hide problems; returning to practice after treatment can be complex. There are gaps in readily available on-site mental health resources and concerns about confidentiality.

Emerging trends: Increasing acceptance of mental health care; states dropping invasive licensing questions
ama-assn.org
. More peer-support teams and wellness committees in hospitals. Wellness curricula and promotion of boundary-setting as self-care (doctors with clear boundaries have much lower burnout
gailgazelle.com
). Emphasis on psychological first aid training and resilience-building workshops. Awareness campaigns (especially through professional societies) encouraging colleagues to speak up and support each other.

Key terminology: Depression/anxiety/PTSD in HCPs; Second Victim Syndrome (provider trauma after an adverse event)
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
; burnout; substance use disorder (SUD); moral injury (feelings after ethical conflict); peer support; confidentiality; psychological first aid; wellness resources.

Domain 2: Burnout, Fatigue and Occupational Stress

Overview: Chronic workplace stress in anesthesia leads to burnout and fatigue, which impair clinicians’ well-being and performance. Burnout (characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced accomplishment) is widespread in anesthesia practice. Physical fatigue from long hours, night shifts and sleep loss further compounds stress. Compassion fatigue – the emotional toll of caring for suffering patients – also overlaps with burnout.

Key subsystems: Burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory dimensions), compassion fatigue, shift/circadian fatigue, sleep deprivation, workload and staffing pressures, administrative burden, loss of autonomy, moral distress, work–rest schedules, individual vs. organizational factors, measuring tools (e.g. MBI), recovery (time off, psychological recovery), and effects on patient safety/performance.

Current state: Surveys show very high burnout rates: an AANA report found that ~39% of CRNAs met burnout criteria during the peak of COVID
aana.com
, and reviews report CRNA burnout prevalence ranging from ~12% to 72% depending on setting
aana.com
. Contributing factors include heavy workload, long hours, limited control over schedule, and poor leadership or team dynamics
aana.com
. One international study found 17.3% of non-physician anesthetists in an Ethiopian hospital had high burnout by standard measures
sciencedirect.com
. Burnout correlates with higher intent to quit and lower job satisfaction
aana.com
. Chronic fatigue and disrupted circadian rhythms are endemic: anesthesiologists who are sleep-deprived show slower responses, impaired judgment, and other performance deficits
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. “Call-inebriated” handovers and post-call decrements are known to occur. Compassion fatigue is recognized as a related but distinct problem (empathic distress from trauma exposure)
aana.com
.

Key challenges: Distinguishing burnout from personal weakness leads to blame on individuals. Staffing shortages force mandatory overtime. The culture of “toughing it out” discourages rest. Emergency-driven schedule changes make planning self-care hard. Providers may feel guilty taking time off. Organizations often under-invest in sustainable staffing. Fatigue creates safety concerns (more errors, as cited by anesthesia leaders
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
).

Emerging trends: Growing recognition of system’s role (Burnout is a public health issue). Institutions implementing duty-hour limits and wellness programs. Use of survey screening (e.g. Professional Fulfillment Index). Mindfulness, peer counseling and resilience training are being offered. Advocacy for ergonomics and safe scheduling. Emphasis on “right to disconnect” policies. Hybrid/part-time positions reduce burnout. Research into tailored interventions (both at individual and workflow levels).

Key terminology: Burnout (“EE/DP/PA” dimensions)
aana.com
; compassion fatigue (secondary traumatic stress)
aana.com
; circadian disruption; workload; shift work disorder; moral injury; NASA TLX (task load index, not anesthesia-specific but relevant for stress measurement); recovery time.

Domain 3: Work-Life Integration & Personal Sustainability

Overview: This domain covers how anesthesia clinicians balance professional demands with personal life to sustain a long career. It includes setting healthy boundaries between work and home, nurturing relationships, and maintaining personal health and identity outside of medicine. Work–life integration is critical for well-being and avoiding burnout.

Key subsystems: Boundary-setting and prioritization; family relationships (partners/spouses, children); social life and friendships; leisure/hobbies; physical health (exercise, nutrition, sleep hygiene); financial security and stress; mental/spiritual self-care; life transitions (marriage, divorce, bereavement, retirement); identity beyond work; generational life stages; care of elders (sandwich generation).

Current state: Spending time with family and friends is the top coping strategy for anesthesiologists (75% cite family/friends as key to happiness)
beckersasc.com
. Yet many report conflict: 38% of anesthesiologists say parenting and work clash significantly
beckersasc.com
. About 50% of physicians actively try to improve diet or lose weight, and many exercise regularly
beckersasc.com
, reflecting awareness of physical health. A majority are married and report good marriages
beckersasc.com
, but scheduling issues strain relationships. Working boundary issues loom large: research shows clinicians with clear limits (“say no” to extra work) are far less likely to burn out
gailgazelle.com
. Anesthetists often seek meaning outside work via religion (67% in one survey) or community, underscoring spiritual/existential needs
beckersasc.com
. Financial worries (debt, retirement planning) add to personal stress. Gender roles affect balance: women disproportionately manage childcare/elders, while men may face societal pressure as primary earners or less taking leave.

Key challenges: The unpredictable OR schedule makes day-to-day planning hard. On-call or weekend duties may lead to missing family events (choir concerts, sports). Saying “no” can be culturally frowned upon, so setting limits is difficult. The “always on” culture (smartphone/email) blurs boundaries. Partners may feel neglected. Leisure and hobbies often take a back seat. Burnout feeds into poor personal health (irregular exercise, sleep loss). Sudden life changes (illness, divorce) can disrupt fragile work-life balance. Planning for long-term events (college, nursing homes) is complex.

Emerging trends: Emphasis on integration (flex-time, part-time roles, remote work for academic tasks). Supportive policies (childcare support, flexible scheduling) are being introduced. Physician wellness programs now often teach boundary skills. Some institutions pilot “protected family time” (no meetings after hours). Increasingly, younger anesthetists advocate publicly for work-life balance and challenge “grind culture.” Retirement planning and “reinvention” resources are more available to help providers find purpose after practice.

Key terminology: Work–life “integration” (not just balance), boundary setting, personal sustainability, role conflict, sandwich generation (caring for kids and elderly)
workplacementalhealth.org
, self-care, wellness (holistic), resilience, and terms like value alignment, work-life harmony.

Domain 4: Pregnancy, Parenting and Family Life in Anesthesia

Overview: Balancing pregnancy and parenting with anesthesia practice involves unique challenges. Providers must navigate physical demands of pregnancy in the OR, manage family planning, and coordinate childcare around unpredictable schedules. Workplaces must accommodate pregnant and nursing clinicians, while parents cope with shift work and career demands.

Key subsystems: Prenatal care and fetal safety; workplace accommodations for pregnancy; fertility and timing concerns; maternity/paternity leave policies; safe anesthesia techniques in pregnancy; breastfeeding/pumping logistics in OR; childcare arrangements (daycare, nannies); parenting infants/toddlers; school-age parenting and school events; marital/partner dynamics; single parenting; caring for elderly family (sandwich generation)
workplacementalhealth.org
; parental guilt and sacrifices; financial planning for family.

Current state: Modern safety data are reassuring: with proper scavenging, occupational exposure to anesthetic gases has not been conclusively linked to miscarriages or birth defects
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Still, many pregnant anesthetists are concerned. A large European survey found only ~41% of pregnant anesthesia trainees felt their working conditions were satisfactory (38% felt “safe”)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, and many chose to limit clinical duties or take sick leave to avoid perceived hazards. Many women delay childbearing due to training pressures (European data show men are more likely than women to have kids during residency
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
). After childbirth, family leave varies: most programs offer 6–8 weeks per institutional policy (ASA recommends ~6–8 weeks), but some providers resume work earlier due to staffing or finances. Nursing mothers must pump during shifts: U.S. law guarantees break time and a private place to pump for up to one year postpartum
dol.gov
, yet finding time in the OR schedule can be hard. Childcare is a constant struggle: early cases and after-hours calls require flexible care solutions (daycare, partner support, relatives). Parenting small children on a shift schedule leads to many missed meals, bedtime routines or school events. Many providers juggle dual caregiver roles (young children and aging parents) as part of the “sandwich generation”
workplacementalhealth.org
.

Key challenges: Stigma or perceived weakness around pregnancy (some fear bias or discrimination when announcing pregnancy). Lack of standardized maternity/paternity leave policies in some practices. Concerns about exposure to N₂O or radiation (many providers avoid N₂O use and limit X-ray proximity in early pregnancy). Pumping sessions require coordination (can disrupt case flow). Limited on-site childcare or “backup” care for emergencies. Working single parents, especially mothers, carry heavy burdens if ill or over-scheduled. Couples in anesthesia specialties often both have odd hours, compounding family logistics. Long-term, people might postpone retirement or late-life family plans due to financial pressures.

Emerging trends: More programs adopting formal family leave and re-entry policies. Greater awareness and support for pregnant clinicians (some departments set low-risk rotation options). Advocating for “pregnancy-friendly” OR environments. Increasing numbers of male providers taking parental leave as norms shift. Employers providing pumping rooms and protected breaks. Use of scheduling software to better accommodate family needs. Growth of peer support groups for parents in anesthesia. Telehealth perianesthesia visits allow providers to consult from home when needed.

Key terminology: Pregnant anesthetist, occupational exposure (to anesthetics, x-ray, etc.), maternity/paternity leave, pumping/pumping break (FLSA accommodations)
dol.gov
, antenatal safety, nursery/childcare coverage, sandwich generation
workplacementalhealth.org
, “baby on board” scheduling, work‐family conflict, family leave policies.

Domain 5: Professional Culture & Workplace Social Dynamics

Overview: Anesthesia practice occurs within a distinctive OR culture characterized by hierarchy, intense teamwork under pressure, and complex social dynamics. This includes formal and informal power structures (e.g. surgeon vs. anesthetist), as well as patterns of civility or incivility, inclusion or exclusion among colleagues. Cultural rituals (pre-op huddles, handoffs) and gender/age norms also shape the lived experience.

Key subsystems: OR hierarchy and authority gradient; interprofessional relations (surgeon-anesthetist, nurse-anesthetist, technician); teamwork and communication (team briefings, debriefings); incivility and bullying; harassment (sexist, racial, etc.); generational differences (Boomers vs GenX vs Millennials); “eating our young” hazing of trainees; social cliques and gossip; professional status (MD vs CRNA, academic vs community); locum vs staff dynamics; shift-group cultures (day vs night “teams”); gendered subcultures (“old boys’ club” vs increasing diversity); and psychological safety (speaking up about patient safety).

Current state: Research shows disturbing prevalence of mistreatment in the OR. Up to 98% of clinicians report witnessing disruptive or disrespectful behavior, and 70% have personally experienced incivility in the past year
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Over a third report being bullied
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In a survey, 90% of nurses had seen bullying and 50% had been bullied
aorn.org
. Notably, physician-on-nurse bullying is especially common in the OR
aorn.org
. These toxic behaviors impair teamwork and even patient safety (incivility has been linked to medical errors and higher mortality
aorn.org
). Power imbalances are clear: anesthesiologists and surgeons rank highest as sources of disruptive behavior
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, reflecting traditional hierarchies. Gender and harassment issues are prominent: recent data indicate ~50% of female anesthesiologists (and 25% of males) experience sexual or gender-based harassment each year
seahq.org
. There is also a “culture of silence” – people often do not speak up about safety concerns due to fear of reprisal or seeming combative. Within anesthesia specifically, conflicts arise over autonomy and role: some CRNAs feel their skill undervalued by physician colleagues, while others pride themselves on independent practice in opt-out states. Newer trainees often describe “hazing” or “trial by fire” learning, reflecting a hidden curriculum of toughness
aorn.org
.

Key challenges: Changing entrenched behavior is very hard. Harassing or bullying colleagues (knowingly or not) can perpetuate a cycle – those abused may later become abusers
aorn.org
. Concerns about “rocking the boat” keep individuals from challenging disrespectful peers or superiors. Diverse teams must navigate biases (e.g. women may experience “boys’ club” exclusion). Locum/temporary providers often feel marginalized and lack a supportive community. Nurses vs physicians sometimes jockey for control, and CRNAs can be caught in between. The fast, high-pressure nature of the OR can prime short tempers. There is tension between individual accountability and systemic culture change.

Emerging trends: Healthcare organizations are promoting “just culture” and zero-tolerance policies for harassment. Checklists and crew-resource-management training emphasize flat team communication. Simulation and leadership training include modules on civility. Social media and professional groups (e.g. #EndNurseBullying campaigns) bring visibility to incivility. Accreditation bodies and hospital policies increasingly require reporting mechanisms for disruptive behavior. Patient safety initiatives stress psychological safety: encouraging all staff to voice concerns. Younger generations (Millennials/Gen Z) are more vocal about respect and work environment, pressuring culture shifts. There is also more awareness of microaggressions and unconscious bias, with training programs emerging.

Key terminology: Incivility, disruptive behavior, hierarchy, authority gradient, creed resource management (CRM), microaggression, toxic culture, eating our young, hidden curriculum, psychological safety, bullying, sexual/racial harassment, and constructs like “unit culture” or “team climate.”

Domain 6: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as Lived Experience

Overview: This domain examines how anesthesiology’s culture and day-to-day practice are shaped by diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues. It focuses on the experiences of underrepresented and minority providers (by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation) within anesthesia, and on systemic inequities they face. It also covers how diversity affects patient care.

Key subsystems: Demographic makeup (race, gender, LGBTQ+, religion, etc. in workforce); minority provider experiences; discrimination and implicit bias among colleagues; gender dynamics (leadership, pay gap, objectification); race/ethnicity bias in professional settings; microaggressions; code-switching (minorities altering behavior to fit in); imposter syndrome in underrepresented trainees; mentorship and sponsorship disparities; patient biases or preferences (e.g. wanting a same-race provider); historical exclusion (e.g. Jim Crow segregation in anesthesia training); and strategies for inclusive culture (allyship, anti-bias training, affinity groups).

Current state: Anesthesia remains predominantly white and female. For example, a 2016 survey found ~97% of CRNAs identified as White
aana.com
, and diversity initiatives have seen only modest gains (as of 2024 ~12% of CRNAs are people of color
diversitycrna.org
). Women now form a majority in nurse anesthesia, but leadership (chair positions) is still less than 20% female
seahq.org
. Pay inequities persist: female anesthesiologists earn on average ~$0.94 for every dollar earned by males
seahq.org
. Underrepresented providers often report feeling “othered” – African American CRNAs like Goldie Brangman (AANA president in 1973
aana.com
) were pioneers. Sexual and gender minorities are only recently studied, but pockets of bias exist (a recent analysis notes common experiences of discrimination by transgender or non-binary anesthesia trainees). Microaggressions (e.g. assumptions about competence, comments on accent) are commonly cited in physician surveys. There are also DEI gaps among patients: some patients explicitly request or avoid providers of certain backgrounds. Recognizing this, professional organizations have launched mentorship programs for diversity (e.g. Diversity in Nurse Anesthesia Mentorship Program
aana.com
) and spotlighted role models (e.g. “Diversity CRNA” spotlights).

Key challenges: Very low representation of minorities and men (in nurse anesthesia) can lead to isolation, stereotype threat, and imposter feelings. Implicit biases by peers or patients may go unaddressed. Lack of mentorship means diverse students may not see a path forward. Discrimination complaints can be fraught to report. Balancing DEI initiatives with backlash or “diversity fatigue” in some quarters. Intersectional issues (e.g. a Black woman physician anesthesiologist faces both gender and racial bias). Current events (e.g. racial justice movements) force reckoning with institutional racism in medicine.

Emerging trends: Focus on pipeline programs to recruit diverse nurse anesthesia candidates. Annual conferences devoted to diversity issues (e.g. DiversityCRNA workshops). Anti-bias training is becoming more common in departments. Use of DEI metrics (tracking hiring, promotion of underrepresented faculty). Employee resource/affinity groups (Women in Anesthesia, LGBTQ+ anesthesia networks). Increased research on health equity (some CRNAs study racial disparities in pain management, etc.). Culturally competent care training, including translating patient materials. Social media communities offer support (Instagram groups, Twitter chats on DEI).

Key terminology: Underrepresented minority (URM), implicit bias, structural racism, intersectionality, microaggression, allyship, inclusive excellence, cultural humility, tokenism, glass ceiling, gender pay gap, LGBTQ+-friendly, diversity pipeline, mentorship/sponsorship.

Domain 7: Professional Identity, Meaning and Purpose

Overview: This domain explores how anesthesia providers define their professional identity and find meaning in their work. It looks at motivations for choosing anesthesia, the formation and evolution of one’s sense of self as a provider, and the pursuit of purpose. It also considers identity challenges – feeling like a technician, having an “impostor” self-perception – and how providers integrate their job role with their personal values.

Key subsystems: Career motivation (why anesthesia); professional self-image (nurse vs provider vs technician); autonomy and authority as identity factors; training identity formation; pride and “calling” in anesthesia; impostor phenomenon at various career stages; crises of meaning (when practice feels routine or bureaucratic); reconciling nurse identity with CRNA autonomy; ethical self-concept (“this is who I am morally”); shift from student → clinician → mentor roles; personal vs professional identity balance; identity in transitions (leadership roles, leaving practice); and narratives (stories providers tell about their role).

Current state: Many choose anesthesia for a blend of science, patient care, and autonomy (though data are limited). Providers often describe pride in being the “patient’s advocate in the OR” – ensuring safety while the patient is unconscious. Identity issues can emerge: some CRNAs report feeling undervalued (“just a nurse”) despite high expertise. Impostor feelings are common in healthcare; a recent AANA article notes many CRNAs struggle with the impostor phenomenon (feeling one will be “found out” as a fraud). Autonomy is central: CRNAs in opt-out states often highlight independence as part of their identity. As careers progress, providers may shift identity – e.g. from clinician to educator or leader. Many hold a strong moral identity (“I take care of people in dire need”). Conversely, when jobs become high-volume or standardized, clinicians may experience a loss of meaning (“just doing cases instead of helping people”). Retiring providers often report challenges in redefining self-worth outside medicine.

Key challenges: When roles are overshadowed (e.g. in a large team OR), providers may wonder “who will remember me?”. CRNAs sometimes struggle with the dual identity of being an RN and an independent clinician. Younger trainees may feel impostor syndrome when learning complex skills. Providers may question their purpose if they become disillusioned by paperwork or commercialization of healthcare. Achieving work that aligns with values (e.g. helping vulnerable patients) can be hard amid productivity pressure.

Emerging trends: Growing emphasis on narrative medicine and reflecting on purpose (some training programs now include reflective essays). Peer support and mentorship often tackle identity issues. Podcasts and blogs (e.g. “Why I Love Being a CRNA”) spread personal stories that reaffirm meaning. Discussions of physician burnout now include loss-of-meaning as a dimension. There is also more discussion about life after anesthesia (retirement planning includes search for new purpose).

Key terminology: Professional identity, calling, vocation, impostor phenomenon, scope of practice (tie to identity), autonomy, self-concept, occupational legacy, moral identity, and phrases like “just a tech” or “physician’s assistant” that reflect identity tensions.

Domain 8: History of Anesthesia & the CRNA Profession

Overview: This domain traces the origins and evolution of anesthesia practice and the nurse anesthesia profession. It covers early anesthetic discovery (ether, chloroform), pioneering figures, the founding of formal anesthesia education, world-war roles, and major milestones in CRNA history. Understanding this history provides context for the profession’s values and struggles.

Key subsystems: 19th- and early 20th-century anesthesia (Ether Dome, chloroform era); first anesthesia providers (dental/student assistants in 1840s); development of nurse anesthesia (Civil War nurses, Crozier in 1890s); early pioneers (Alice Magaw, "Mother of Anesthesia", who managed ~14,000 open-drop ether anesthesias and published results
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
); Agatha Hodgins (created the Lakeside School of Anesthesia in 1915 and helped found the AANA
case.edu
); formation of the AANA (Lakeside alumnae group in 1923 became the AANA)
case.edu
; WWI/WWII contributions (Hodgins in field hospitals
case.edu
, CRNAs in military medical corps); evolution of training (from hospital diploma schools to university-based programs, first BSN-entry programs in 1970s, first DNP programs in 2000s); key dates (1956 CRNA credential adopted
aana.com
; 1986 CRNA direct Medicare reimbursement
aana.com
; 2001 Iowa “opt-out” from federal supervision rule
aana.com
); diversity milestones (Goldie Brangman first African-American AANA president in 1973
aana.com
); and international spread (e.g. nurse anesthesia development in Europe and other regions).

Current state: The century-long narrative of nurse anesthetists is one of advancing education and autonomy. Early trailblazers (Magaw at Mayo, Hodgins in Cleveland
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
case.edu
) showcased safety and innovation. Over decades, nurse anesthesia fought for recognition: by 1956 the specialty had a formal credential, and by 1986 CRNAs won independent Medicare payments
aana.com
. The AANA (founded in the 1930s) has guided policy and advocacy. Today, most U.S. anesthesia programs require a doctoral degree (DNP/DNAP), reflecting the profession’s push to match the level of training of other advanced practice fields. CRNAs now practice in all 50 states (even without direct physician supervision in some) and serve in roles from solo rural practice to academic departments. Historical struggles – for example, early legal battles over scope – have largely given way to legislative efforts; notably, many states now permit nurse anesthesia under state law (some “opt-out” of federal supervision requirements, as first done by Iowa in 2001
aana.com
). Interactions with physician anesthesia have evolved from outright opposition to formal collaboration in most settings.

Key challenges: Recognizing and honoring the history is a challenge as the field modernizes. There is tension between maintaining nursing heritage versus advancing an independent provider image. The path to doctoral education raises questions about access and implications for nursing identity. Globally, nurse anesthesia varies widely: in some countries nurse anesthetists are not formally recognized, or are replaced by physician anesthesiologists, which can create inter-professional friction internationally.

Emerging trends: Professional organizations celebrate history (e.g. naming awards after Magaw or Hodgins). Centennial commemorations (AANA was founded 1931) highlight pioneers. Current advocacy often invokes historical examples of independence to justify scope expansions. The narrative of diversity in CRNAs (highlighting first female/Black leaders) is used to inspire inclusion. Historical lessons (e.g. errors made) inform modern safety culture. There is growing interest in international history and comparative anesthesia care models.

Key terminology: Ether, chloroform, open-drop technique; AANA (American Association of Nurse Anesthetists); Lakeside School of Anesthesia; CRNA credential; opt-out; Medicare Part B reimbursement; doctorate in nurse anesthesia (DNAP, DNP); “Mother of Anesthesia” (Alice Magaw)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
; Agatha Hodgins Award (AANA award); historical figures (Goldie Brangman, etc.); first female/male presidents; and key case law (e.g., legal cases on scope, though those are more Pillar 4/legal).

Domain 9: Public Perception & Societal Understanding

Overview: This domain addresses how patients, the public, and other professionals perceive anesthesia and its providers. It covers patient knowledge and fears about anesthesia, media portrayals (or lack thereof), and inter-professional respect. It also looks at how societies understand the value of CRNAs and how the profession communicates its role to the public.

Key subsystems: Patient perceptions (trust in anesthetists, fear of anesthesia); general public understanding (what anesthesia is, awareness of provider roles); common fears/myths (fear of not waking, awareness under anesthesia, pain); identification of providers (who does anesthesia – MDs vs CRNAs); media and popular culture portrayals; social media discourse; marketing and public relations (ASA/AANA campaigns, CRNA Week); inter-professional image (how surgeons, nurses, other doctors see CRNAs); patient choice/preference (does a patient request anesthesiologist or CRNA?); public education efforts.

Current state: Many patients find anesthesia mysterious. Surveys show that anesthesia ranks as the third-most common preoperative fear (after surgery and complications) for about 40% of patients
mdpi.com
. Notably, over 25% of patients did not even know that an anesthesiologist is a physician
mdpi.com
, illustrating widespread lack of basic knowledge. Patients often fear not waking up, pain after surgery, or “waking up” during anesthesia. Public trust is generally high (anesthesia mortality is extremely low in modern practice), but misperceptions linger. Media portrayal of anesthesia is rare and usually inaccurate – anesthesia providers are seldom main characters on TV, and when they appear it’s often as a background figure. Social media has given CRNAs a voice (Instagram and Twitter anecdotes about OR life), but also a forum for “horror” stories or myths. CRNAs themselves often report patients being surprised when told their anesthetist is a nurse by training. Among colleagues, CRNAs are generally respected, though there can be biases (some surgeons assume anesthesiologist backup, or some hospitalists underestimate CRNA expertise). Associations run public campaigns (e.g. “Be Anesthesia Aware” by ASA) to educate patients about anesthesia safety and providers’ roles.

Key challenges: Overcoming the “unknown”: many patients view anesthesia as just being asleep and may undervalue the provider’s skill. Surgeons sometimes under-communicate the role of the anesthesia team to patients. Confusion between different provider types (anesthesiologist, CRNA, AA) can lead to surprise or mistrust. Publicing highlighting high-profile “anesthesia mishaps” (though rare) can cause disproportionate fear. CRNAs sometimes face skepticism from patients who prefer physician coverage. Geographic variation in terminology (“nurse anesthetist” can confuse patients in some areas). The rise of misinformation (e.g. social media anecdotes about anesthesia awareness) complicates the public narrative.

Emerging trends: More patient education initiatives – e.g. video materials explaining anesthesia to patients before surgery. “Meet your anesthetist” programs to introduce providers. Use of social media hashtags (#CRNAWeek) for outreach. Greater media presence of anesthesia in context of global health or leadership (anesthetists promoting vaccines, etc.). Public awareness campaigns highlighting anesthesia’s safety improvements and CRNA training (emphasizing CRNA’s status as advanced practice providers). Trend towards transparency (some hospitals now list the anesthesia provider’s qualifications in patient portals). Community outreach events (health fairs, school talks) to demystify anesthesia.

Key terminology: Anesthesia awareness (often misunderstood as “waking up during surgery”); anxieties/fear of anesthesia; “pre-op visit”; perioperative care; propofol, naloxone, etc. for media examples; CRNA vs. MD differentiation; patient rights; informed consent (patients often conflate surgeon consent with anesthesia); anesthesia education; “Hello, my name is” campaign (for all providers to introduce themselves).

Domain 10: Ethical Identity, Moral Dimensions and Environmental Impact

Overview: This domain looks at the moral and ethical aspects of anesthesia practice, and its environmental consequences. It includes moral distress (conflicts between one’s ethics and workplace demands), daily ethical dilemmas (patient autonomy, end-of-life decisions, disclosure of errors), and the profession’s conscience in matters like participation in executions. It also covers the environmental ethics of anesthetic gas emissions and waste.

Key subsystems: Moral distress (feeling forced to act against one’s values); ethical dilemmas (e.g. to comply with futile care, DNR conflicts in OR, pain vs addiction); truth-telling after adverse events; patient autonomy (respecting wishes vs doing what’s safe); resource stewardship (allocating scarce OR or ICU resources); controversial roles (lethal injection, abortion anesthesia provisions); institutional ethics (hospital policies vs provider morality). Environmental: greenhouse gases from volatile anesthetics (desflurane, nitrous oxide), OR waste (single-use devices, plastics), green anesthesia initiatives, carbon footprint of surgery, life-cycle of anesthesia equipment, sustainability practices, low-flow anesthesia, waste anesthetic gas (WAG) capture, and professional guidelines on climate.

Current state: Anesthetists regularly face morally challenging situations. For example, administering anesthesia for a surgery that may be non-beneficial (“unfutile” care) can cause internal conflict. End-of-life care (calling rapid response for a dying patient, or respecting an advance directive in perioperative setting) can cause distress. The issue of anesthetists participating in executions has been highly contentious: U.S. courts once required anesthesiologists for lethal injection protocols, but professional ethics organizations firmly reject it. For instance, the American Board of Anesthesiology has warned it will revoke certification of anyone who participates in an execution
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, citing that “anesthesiologists are ‘healers, not executioners’”
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In terms of environmental impact, awareness is rising: anesthetic gases are potent greenhouse agents. Desflurane’s global-warming potential is ~2540 times that of CO₂
a4anesthesia.com
, making it the largest contributor (≈80%) of OR gas emissions
a4anesthesia.com
. Nitrous oxide and sevoflurane also have significant footprints. The medical sector’s carbon footprint is comparable to a major country’s emissions, and operating rooms account for a large share. Waste disposal (unused drugs, disposable supplies) also raises sustainability concerns.

Key challenges: Balancing efficiency with ethics (pressure to finish cases vs ensuring patient values). Moral distress can lead to burnout if unaddressed. Conscience issues around controversial policies (e.g. should one comply with involuntary takes of patients to OR). Lack of training in ethics: many anesthetists feel unprepared for these dilemmas. On environment: switching away from high-impact gases (like desflurane) can conflict with habitual practice or marketing pressures. Some clinicians may be resistant to change due to cost or skepticism. There are also trade-offs between single-use items for sterility and environmental harm.

Emerging trends: Institutional ethics support (ethics committees, consults) are becoming more available. Debriefings after critical events often include moral reflection. Education on bioethics in anesthesia residency is expanding. Shared decision-making with patients (including goals-of-care discussions) is emphasized to align interventions with values. On the environment side, ASA and others have formed “greening” committees. Many departments are adopting low-flow anesthesia, recycling, and even researching anesthetic gas capture technologies

. Some hospitals are cutting desflurane use dramatically for climate reasons (one department removed desflurane vaporizers, dropping usage from 20% to 5% of cases

). “Green OR” checklists and sustainability officers are emerging roles. Anesthetists are increasingly seen as environmental stewards in hospitals, influencing purchasing and waste policies.
